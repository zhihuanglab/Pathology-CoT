The green box is placed on one of the larger lymph nodes in the center of the slide. I am zooming into the periphery of the lymphoid tissue, near the capsule and subcapsular sinus. This is a critical area to inspect because metastatic tumor cells arriving via lymphatic vessels typically first deposit and grow in this subcapsular region. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the standard procedure for staging colorectal cancer involves examining every lymph node submitted. The area indicated by the green box is one of these potential lymph nodes, located in the lower right portion of the slide. I am zooming in to meticulously inspect its architecture and cellular composition to determine if it is a benign (negative) lymph node or if it contains metastatic tumor cells (positive node). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my approach is to examine every lymph node thoroughly. The zoomed-in area, indicated by the green box, is on one of the lymph nodes located in the upper right of the slide. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic review of all submitted lymph nodes. The purpose of zooming in is to assess the lymph node architecture and cellular detail at high magnification, which is essential for detecting small metastatic deposits, isolated tumor cells, or subtle architectural effacement that might not be visible at low power. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. This is the third lymph node section from the top on the left side. I am zooming into this specific area at the periphery of the lymph node because this is the subcapsular sinus region. This is the most common location for the initial arrival and deposit of metastatic tumor cells. At low power, this part of the node appears more densely purple and architecturally disrupted compared to the rest of the lymphoid tissue, which is suspicious for a metastatic focus. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it is located within a lymph node (the large one in the bottom right quadrant) that shows some architectural abnormalities even at low power. The green box is placed over the periphery of the lymphoid tissue, near the subcapsular sinus, which is a classic location for early metastatic deposits to arrive. The area appears somewhat disorganized and heterogeneous in color compared to the more uniform purple of other lymphoid areas, raising suspicion for infiltration by non-lymphoid cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. The green box highlights a specific area within one of the smaller lymph nodes in the lower right quadrant. This area corresponds to the hilum of the lymph node, which is the region where blood vessels and lymphatic channels enter and exit. At low power, this hilar area appears somewhat disorganized and more eosinophilic (pink) compared to the surrounding dense lymphoid tissue. The hilum and the subcapsular sinus are the most common initial sites for metastatic tumor cells to lodge. Therefore, any subtle architectural or cytologic abnormality in this region requires high-magnification review to rule out micrometastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
