This node is highly suspicious for metastasis at low power due to the extensive basophilic area. I have zoomed into the margin of this suspicious area to confirm the nature of the cells. This interface is crucial for distinguishing between a reactive process and a malignancy, and also to assess for extranodal extension (tumor spreading beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat), which is a key prognostic feature. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is located within the largest central lymph node, which shows significant basophilia at low power. This appearance is highly suggestive of a positive lymph node. The purpose of zooming in is to examine the cellular morphology at high magnification to confirm the presence of metastatic carcinoma cells and assess the extent of nodal replacement. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is placed on one of the lymph nodes in the lower right quadrant. This node, like others in the field, shows a significant dark purple infiltrate, raising suspicion for metastatic disease. I would zoom into this area to closely examine the cellular morphology of the infiltrate to confirm if it represents metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma or another process, such as a reactive lymphoid hyperplasia or a lymphoma, and to assess for extranodal extension. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to examine every lymph node to screen for metastasis. This particular area, located in the lower right, is one of the lymph nodes that appears highly suspicious at low power due to its dark, solid appearance. I am zooming in to assess the cellular morphology in detail to determine if the cells are benign lymphocytes or malignant metastatic tumor cells, and to evaluate the extent of involvement. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic examination of all submitted lymph nodes. This particular node, located on the right side of the image, shows a dense, solid, dark purple region that nearly replaces the entire node. This appearance is highly suspicious for a positive lymph node, where normal lymphoid architecture is effaced by metastatic carcinoma. The zoom is aimed at the interface between the dense cellular area and the surrounding fat to assess the cells' morphology and look for potential extranodal extension. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The infiltrating cells have features more consistent with small lymphocytes rather than typical colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (which are usually larger, have more cytoplasm, and form glands). While the extensive infiltration and effacement of the node are very suspicious for metastasis, the cytology itself is not classic for carcinoma. This could represent a lymph node completely replaced by tumor, but it could also be a florid reactive process or even a lymphoma. Further examination of other areas and potentially immunohistochemistry (e.g., for cytokeratins) would be required to make a definitive diagnosis."
