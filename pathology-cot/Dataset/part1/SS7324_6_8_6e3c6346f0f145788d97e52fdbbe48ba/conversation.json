The reason for examining this interface between the dense tumor deposit within the node and the surrounding perinodal fat is to assess for extranodal extension (ENE). ENE is a critical prognostic factor, and it is defined by tumor cells breaching the lymph node capsule and invading the adjacent soft tissue. This interface is the exact location to look for this feature. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol requires a systematic examination of every lymph node on the slide to search for metastatic disease. The green box highlights one of these lymph nodes, located in the middle-right portion of the slide. I am zooming into this area as part of my routine, comprehensive evaluation to assess its architecture at high magnification and to look for any atypical cell clusters that would be indicative of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. I chose to zoom into this specific area because this lymph node appears almost completely replaced by a dense, basophilic infiltrate at low magnification. The normal architecture, including the distinction between cortex and medulla and the presence of germinal centers, is lost. This solid, dark appearance is highly suspicious for extensive metastatic carcinoma, making it a priority to examine at high power to confirm the presence and morphology of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this specific area, located in the bottom-right tissue fragment, as part of my systematic evaluation of all tissue submitted. This fragment is not one of the large, obvious lymph nodes, but it contains a small, dense, basophilic aggregate, which indicates the presence of lymphoid tissue. It could be a very small lymph node, a fragment of a larger node, or a tertiary lymphoid structure. The interface between this lymphoid tissue and the surrounding adipose tissue is a critical area to examine for metastasis. I need to determine if there are tumor cells present, and if so, whether they are confined to the node or have spread into the surrounding fat (extranodal extension), or if this represents a discrete tumor deposit in the fat (N1c). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the third lymph node from the left, located in the upper-left quadrant. The zoom is specifically focused on the fatty tissue at the periphery of this lymph node. After identifying a lymph node that is suspicious for metastasis, it is crucial to carefully examine its capsule and the surrounding pericolic fat. The goal is to look for evidence of extranodal extension (ENE), which is the spread of tumor beyond the lymph node capsule. ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor and must be reported for accurate staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, it is crucial to examine every single piece of tissue submitted to accurately stage the cancer. The area of interest, indicated by the green box, is a small, isolated tissue fragment separate from the larger, more obvious lymph nodes. This fragment contains a small, dense, basophilic focus that requires high-power examination to determine its nature. It could be a very small lymph node, a lymphoid aggregate, or, critically, a small metastatic tumor deposit (satellite nodule). Missing such a finding would have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
