On the far right, there is a well-circumscribed, ovoid, and intensely basophilic (purple) structure, which is classic for a lymph node. In the center, there are several irregular fragments of fibro-adipose tissue, which likely represent part of the mesocolic fat dissection and may contain additional, smaller lymph nodes. On the left, there is a larger, more disorganized tissue fragment with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, which could represent a portion of the primary tumor or a lymph node largely replaced by tumor. In total, I can identify at least one definite lymph node and other suspicious areas requiring careful examination."

The structure on the right is unequivocally a lymph node based on its low-power morphology. I am systematically examining each lymph node present on the slide. The zoom area is located in the parenchyma of this lymph node, away from the fatty hilum. I would zoom into this area, and multiple other areas, to screen for metastatic tumor cells at high magnification. The goal is to carefully inspect the lymphoid architecture for any foreign cell populations, such as atypical glands or nests of epithelial cells, which would confirm a positive lymph node (metastasis). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There is no evidence of normal lymph node architecture, such as distinct follicles with germinal centers or clearly defined sinuses. The pattern is monotonous. There are some irregular clear spaces, which could be artifactual or represent sinuses that are compressed and effaced by the dense lymphoid population. Most importantly, in this specific field of view, I do not see any definitive metastatic carcinoma cells\u2014no glandular structures, signet-ring cells, or nests of atypical epithelial cells. My impression is that this is lymphoid tissue, and while it lacks clear signs of metastasis, the effaced architecture could be suspicious. The complete examination of the entire node is necessary to rule out micrometastasis. This could represent a lymph node with a reactive process or, less likely in this context, a lymphomatous infiltrate, but the primary concern remains ruling out carcinoma."
