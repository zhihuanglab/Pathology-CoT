I am zooming into this specific area because it highlights the interface between what appears to be residual normal lymphoid tissue (the dense, dark purple area) and a more disorganized, infiltrative-looking region with mixed pink and purple staining. This junction is the most informative location to confirm the presence of metastasis, as it allows for direct comparison between the normal lymphocytes and the potential tumor cells invading the node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the border of the second (central) lymph node. The reason for this specific zoom is to investigate the interface between the lymph node parenchyma and the surrounding pericolic adipose and fibrous tissue. At low power, this border appears blurred and infiltrated, which is highly suspicious for extranodal extension (ENE) of metastatic tumor. ENE is a critical prognostic factor that must be carefully assessed, and it is defined by tumor cells breaching the lymph node capsule and invading the surrounding fat. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the third lymph node from the left. I would zoom into the area indicated by the green box because it shows a distinct, well-demarcated region with a different color and texture from the surrounding lymphoid tissue. At low power, this area appears to contain nests of eosinophilic (pink) cells, which is a classic appearance for metastatic carcinoma deposits within a lymph node. The goal is to confirm the presence of malignant epithelial cells at high magnification. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
