I can identify several discrete, more basophilic (purple) nodules embedded within the fat, which are highly suspicious for lymph nodes. In total, there appear to be at least 4-5 potential lymph nodes or tissue nodules scattered across the slide. Some areas also show significant hemorrhage (red areas). My first impression is to systematically locate and examine each of these potential lymph nodes for evidence of cancer."

Therefore, it is standard procedure to zoom into every structure that resembles a lymph node to examine it at high power for the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

These glands are irregular, crowded, and show complex cribriform (sieve-like) patterns. The cells lining these glands exhibit significant nuclear atypia, including enlargement, hyperchromasia (dark staining), and irregular nuclear contours. There is also a desmoplastic stromal reaction (dense, fibrous connective tissue) surrounding the glands. This is a classic presentation of metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with a colorectal primary. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node, completely effaced by metastatic tumor."
