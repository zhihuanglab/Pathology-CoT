The area in the green box contains the third lymph node from the top on the left side.

I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the task is to find positive lymph nodes. I would systematically examine each piece of tissue on the slide. The selected area is on the second lymph node from the top right. I am zooming into the edge of the lymphoid tissue to carefully inspect the subcapsular sinus and the interface with the surrounding perinodal fat, as this is a common location for initial metastatic deposits. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node on the slide. The green box is placed on the second lymph node from the top on the right side. I am zooming into the periphery of this node, at the junction between the lymphoid tissue and the surrounding fat. This is a critical area to inspect, as the subcapsular sinus is often the first site of metastatic tumor cell deposition. I need to closely evaluate this interface for any suspicious cell clusters or architectural abnormalities. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would conduct a systematic review of all tissue fragments on the slide. The area in the green box is the first lymph node at the top-left of the slide.

This feature is known as extranodal extension (ENE). While the tumor cells appear as sheets of small blue cells, somewhat atypical for conventional colorectal adenocarcinoma, the infiltrative pattern into fat is a definitive sign of malignancy. My impression is that this is a positive (metastatic) lymph node with extranodal extension."
