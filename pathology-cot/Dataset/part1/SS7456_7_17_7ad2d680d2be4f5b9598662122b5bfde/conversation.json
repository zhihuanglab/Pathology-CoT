There is a large, deeply basophilic (purple) mass that appears to be an infiltrative tumor, disrupting the normal mucosal and submucosal architecture and extending deep into the wall. The tumor seems to occupy a significant portion of the tissue section. The surrounding pericolic fat contains some circular structures that could be lymph nodes, but the primary feature is the large tumor mass. This does not appear to be a lymph node section, but rather a section of the primary tumor."

Examining this specific location is critical for determining the pathological T stage, which is defined by the depth of tumor invasion. I need to assess whether the tumor is invading into the muscularis propria, through it, or into the surrounding pericolic adipose tissue. Additionally, I would scrutinize this invasive margin for other high-risk features like lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), and tumor budding, all of which have significant prognostic implications. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The tumor cells are characterized by round to oval nuclei with coarse, stippled ('salt-and-pepper') chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is significant pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. Some areas show necrosis and hemorrhage. The overall morphology is highly suggestive of a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (large cell type) or a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features. This confirms deep invasion by a high-grade malignancy."
