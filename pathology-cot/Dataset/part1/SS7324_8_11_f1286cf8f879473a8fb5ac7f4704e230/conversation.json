The goal is to evaluate its architecture and cellular composition at higher magnification to look for tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

A notable feature is the presence of abundant brown-black pigment within the sinuses and interfollicular areas, likely representing hemosiderin or carbon pigment (anthracosis). I do not see any definite nests of atypical epithelial cells or abnormal glandular structures to suggest metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression is that this is a reactive lymph node with sinus histiocytosis and pigment deposition, which appears to be negative for metastasis."
