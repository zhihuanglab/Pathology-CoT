The malignant epithelial cells show significant nuclear atypia, including hyperchromasia, irregular nuclear contours, and prominent nucleoli. A key finding is the presence of extensive central eosinophilic material within the glands, which is characteristic of 'dirty necrosis'. The surrounding stroma is desmoplastic, indicating a host reaction to the invasion. My impression is that of a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, with features typical for a colorectal primary."
