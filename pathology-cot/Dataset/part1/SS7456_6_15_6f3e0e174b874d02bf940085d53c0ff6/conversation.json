The selected area is at the peripheral interface between the suspicious tumor deposit and the surrounding adipose tissue. The main goal is to confirm the malignant nature of these cells and, critically, to assess for the presence of extranodal extension (tumor invading beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat), which is an important prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the lower-left lymph node. This area represents the densest part of the cellular infiltrate that is replacing the normal lymph node tissue. The purpose of this high-power examination is to closely inspect the cytology of these infiltrating cells to confirm if they are malignant epithelial cells, characteristic of metastatic adenocarcinoma, as opposed to a lymphoproliferative process. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the densely cellular, dark purple area of the lower-left lymph node. My goal is to confirm the suspicion of metastasis. At high power, I need to examine the cytology of these cells to determine if they are malignant epithelial cells (carcinoma) or reactive lymphocytes. The area selected is a representative part of the suspicious deposit, allowing for a definitive diagnosis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the lymph node on the left. While there is a large, obvious tumor mass in the lower part of this node, the selected area is a smaller, more diffusely infiltrated focus at the periphery. I would examine this area to: 1) Confirm that this separate focus is also metastatic tumor. 2) Assess the pattern of infiltration at the edge of the node. 3) Look for evidence of extranodal extension, which is the invasion of tumor cells into the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. Examining less dense areas of infiltration is crucial for a complete assessment. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the lower-left lymph node, which appears to be almost completely effaced by tumor. I have zoomed into the periphery of the nodal tissue, at the interface between the dense tumor infiltrate and the surrounding perinodal fat. The primary reason for investigating this specific area is to assess for extranodal extension (ENE). ENE is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding adipose tissue, which is a critical prognostic factor. This interface is the best location to identify such invasion. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the second lymph node from the left (the one on the right). The zoom area is located at the periphery of the large tumor deposit. I would zoom into this specific area to assess the interface between the metastatic tumor and the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. The key question is whether the tumor is confined within the lymph node capsule or has breached it to invade the surrounding fat. This feature, known as extranodal extension (ENE), is a very important prognostic factor and must be reported. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the lower-left lymph node. The large basophilic area is highly suspicious for metastasis. I am zooming into the area in the green box because it shows the interface between the tumor deposit and the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. This is a critical area to examine in order to assess for the presence of extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat. ENE is a significant prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
