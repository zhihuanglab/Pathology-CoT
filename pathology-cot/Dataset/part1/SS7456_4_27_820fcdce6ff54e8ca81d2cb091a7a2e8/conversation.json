Most of these appear to be lymph nodes, characterized by their round to oval shape and dense, basophilic (purple) appearance. One larger section at the top left shows the folded architecture of intestinal mucosa, likely the primary tumor resection. Some lymph nodes appear entirely dark purple, while others show mixed coloring or evidence of tattoo ink (bottom center), which is used to mark tumor locations during colonoscopy. The overall impression is a colorectal cancer resection specimen that includes the primary tumor and multiple dissected lymph nodes for staging."

Therefore, every identifiable lymph node must be carefully examined at high magnification. The green box is placed on one of these potential lymph nodes (the second one from the top on the left). At this low power, the node appears cellular and somewhat heterogeneous, which raises suspicion. It is crucial to zoom in to differentiate between a reactive process (benign) and the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task is to assess all submitted lymph nodes for evidence of metastasis. The green box highlights a lymph node on the lower left. I would zoom into this specific area for two main reasons:\n1.  **To assess the lymph node-fat interface:** This is a critical area. Metastatic cells often first deposit in the subcapsular sinus, located just beneath the node's outer capsule. \n2.  **To look for extranodal extension (ENE):** The irregular border of this lymph node at low power is suspicious. Zooming in allows for evaluation of whether the tumor has breached the lymph node capsule and is invading the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor that must be reported. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each piece of tissue that appears to be a lymph node to assess for the presence of metastasis, which is crucial for cancer staging. The area indicated by the green box is a well-defined, basophilic nodule, consistent with a lymph node. This is the lymph node located in the bottom-middle of the slide. I need to magnify it to evaluate its architecture and cellular detail to rule in or rule out the presence of cancer cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is placed over a well-circumscribed, ovoid tissue fragment in the upper right, which at low power is clearly a lymph node. To stage a colorectal cancer case, it is mandatory to examine every lymph node for the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I am zooming into this specific lymph node (the most prominent one in the upper right quadrant) to assess its architecture and cellular components to determine if it is a benign/reactive node or if it contains metastatic adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The lower portion of the image shows a dense sheet of small, dark, round cells with scant cytoplasm, which are lymphocytes, characteristic of the native lymph node tissue. In contrast, the upper portion is infiltrated by clusters and nests of larger, atypical cells. These cells have more abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm, larger and more irregularly shaped (pleomorphic) nuclei with vesicular chromatin.

The key finding is that the lymphoid tissue is not well-circumscribed by a capsule. Instead, aggregates of lymphoid cells are seen irregularly infiltrating into the surrounding fat. This finding represents the effacement of the normal lymph node architecture and is characteristic of extranodal extension. While the cells seen infiltrating the fat in this particular field are lymphocytes, a pathologist would carefully scrutinize the entire periphery of this node to identify the non-native malignant epithelial cells that define metastatic carcinoma. The presence of tumor cells in this location would confirm a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma with extranodal extension."
