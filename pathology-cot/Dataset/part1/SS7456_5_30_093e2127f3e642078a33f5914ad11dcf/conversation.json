I can identify at least 3-4 potential lymph nodes of varying sizes scattered within the fat. The overall tissue appears to be a lymph node dissection from a colorectal cancer resection specimen. The area highlighted by the green box is one of the more prominent and cellular-appearing nodules, making it a key area for investigation."

I am zooming into this specific area to examine its cytoarchitectural features at high magnification to determine if it is a benign/reactive lymph node or if it contains metastatic adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

These cells are organized into vague nodules and are seen infiltrating the surrounding adipose tissue. There are no signs of metastatic carcinoma, such as atypical glandular structures, large pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli, or mucin production. My impression is that this is a lymph node that is negative for metastatic carcinoma. The dense and somewhat monotonous lymphoid infiltrate could suggest a reactive process or possibly a low-grade B-cell lymphoma (like SLL/CLL), but for the specific task of staging colorectal cancer, the crucial finding is the absence of metastasis."
