The area in the green box, located in the bottom-left tissue section, is clearly a lymph node. It is imperative to examine every identified lymph node at high magnification to determine if it is benign (reactive) or malignant (containing metastatic tumor cells). Therefore, I am zooming into this specific lymph node to assess its architecture and cellular components for signs of cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There are dense sheets of small, dark lymphocytes mixed with larger, atypical cells that have irregular nuclei and more eosinophilic cytoplasm, consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, there are prominent features of tumor-related changes, including areas of necrosis (amorphous pink material), hemorrhage (collections of red blood cells), and numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages (cells containing coarse brown pigment). My impression is that this is a positive lymph node, extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma with associated necrosis and hemorrhage."
