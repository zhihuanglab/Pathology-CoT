I do not see any definite nests of atypical epithelial cells, abnormal gland formation, or extensive necrosis that would be characteristic of metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression is that this is a reactive lymph node, likely showing follicular hyperplasia, and based on this view, it is negative for metastasis."
