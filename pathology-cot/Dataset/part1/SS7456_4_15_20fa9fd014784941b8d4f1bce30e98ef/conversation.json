The lymph node tissue is very cellular and densely packed with lymphoid cells (the dark purple area). I do not see any definite evidence of metastatic carcinoma, such as atypical glands or nests of malignant epithelial cells, within this specific field. The appearance is more consistent with a reactive lymph node, which shows increased cellularity due to an immune response. My initial impression of this specific area is that it is a lymph node negative for metastasis, but the entire lymph node must be carefully examined at different magnifications to confirm this."
