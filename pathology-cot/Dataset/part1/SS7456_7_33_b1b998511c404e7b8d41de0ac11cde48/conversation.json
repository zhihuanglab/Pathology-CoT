This specific area, located in the adipose tissue between the uppermost lymph node and the one below it, is a critical region to scrutinize. I am systematically searching for several key prognostic features: \n1. **Extranodal Extension (ENE):** To see if tumor cells from the lymph node have broken through the capsule and are invading the surrounding fat.\n2. **Tumor Deposits (TDs):** To look for discrete nodules of cancer in the fat that are separate from the primary tumor and have no residual lymph node tissue.\n3. **Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI):** To identify tumor cells within blood or lymphatic vessels in the perinodal fat.\nThis systematic scan of the fat is essential for accurate cancer staging (N stage). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The green box is placed on one of the lymph nodes located in the lower-left quadrant of the slide. I would zoom into this area as part of a comprehensive review of all submitted nodes. This specific node appears intact and densely cellular, requiring high-magnification assessment to scrutinize its architecture and cytology for any atypical cell clusters that would indicate metastatic cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this specific area on the lower right lymph node because its border appears irregular and ill-defined. The interface between the dense lymphoid tissue and the surrounding lighter-colored perinodal fat is not smooth. This is suspicious for either a large metastatic deposit replacing the normal lymph node architecture and/or extranodal extension (ENE), where the tumor has broken through the lymph node capsule to invade the surrounding fat. Examining this junction at high power is critical to confirm metastasis and assess for ENE. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The zoom box is placed on the periphery of the lymph node located in the upper right quadrant of the image. This area, specifically the subcapsular sinus, is a critical region to inspect because it is the initial site where metastatic cancer cells from an epithelial malignancy typically deposit after arriving via lymphatic drainage. Examining this area first is a high-yield step in screening the node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the lymph node in the upper right quadrant of the image. The reason for zooming into this specific area is that at low power, it appears architecturally abnormal. While much of the node is a uniform dark purple, this region looks lighter, more heterogeneous, and has a disrupted pattern. This is highly suspicious for a metastatic deposit, as tumor cells infiltrating a lymph node disrupt the normal architecture of lymphoid follicles and sinuses. The standard procedure is to screen all lymph nodes for such irregularities. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
