The purpose of this zoom is to examine the cytological and architectural features of the infiltrating cells at high magnification to confirm that they are malignant and to characterize the type of tumor. Specifically, I am looking for features of adenocarcinoma, such as gland formation, nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and necrosis, to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to identify and count all positive lymph nodes for accurate cancer staging (N stage). While other nodes appear obviously positive, it is crucial to examine every potential lymph node, regardless of size. The area in the green box highlights a small, well-circumscribed lymphoid aggregate. I need to zoom in to determine if this is a lymph node and, if so, whether it contains metastatic carcinoma, as even a small focus of metastasis would classify it as a positive node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area to confirm my initial suspicion of metastatic disease. This specific lymph node (the first on the top right) shows extensive replacement by abnormal-appearing tissue. I need to examine the cellular morphology at high magnification to confirm that these are malignant epithelial cells (carcinoma) and to assess the pattern of infiltration, which would definitively classify this node as positive for metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this specific area, located at the periphery of the first and largest lymph node on the left, to assess for extranodal extension (ENE). This location is the interface between the tumor-infiltrated lymph node and the surrounding adipose tissue. Examining this junction is critical to determine if the tumor has breached the lymph node capsule and invaded the perinodal fat, which is a key prognostic factor and a requirement for staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine each lymph node to screen for metastatic carcinoma. The green box is placed on the bottom right lymph node, which is the fourth node I would likely examine in a clockwise pattern. This area is densely cellular (dark purple), which could be either a benign reactive lymphoid follicle or a nest of tumor cells. High magnification is necessary to assess the cellular morphology and architecture to make this distinction. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
