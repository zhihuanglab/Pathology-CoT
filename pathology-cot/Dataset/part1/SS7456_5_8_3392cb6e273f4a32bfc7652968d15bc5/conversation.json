I can identify approximately 5 to 6 distinct, ovoid structures with dense, dark purple (basophilic) areas, which are characteristic of lymph nodes. These are embedded in lighter pink, web-like tissue, which is adipose (fat) tissue. There are also some elongated, eosinophilic structures, possibly representing bone or fibrous tissue from the surgical resection margin. My first impression is that this is a lymph node dissection from a colorectal cancer resection, and the task is to systematically evaluate each lymph node for metastasis."

The green box is centered on a small, distinct basophilic nodule, which is highly suspicious for being a lymph node (or a fragment of one). It's crucial to examine every such structure, regardless of size, to rule out the presence of metastatic tumor cells. This appears to be the third potential lymph node counting from the top. Examining the interface between the lymphoid tissue and the surrounding fat is particularly important for detecting metastatic deposits and extranodal extension. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area to examine the smallest and most inferior (bottom-most) tissue fragment. At low power, this fragment appears almost entirely replaced by a dense, basophilic infiltrate, which is a strong indicator of metastatic carcinoma. It is crucial to examine every piece of submitted tissue, no matter how small, to accurately stage the cancer. This particular fragment requires high-magnification assessment to confirm the presence and nature of the cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the primary task is to find any positive lymph nodes. The green box highlights a small, densely basophilic tissue fragment at the bottom of the slide, which is morphologically consistent with a lymph node. It is crucial to examine every potential lymph node, regardless of size. I am zooming in on this fragment, which is one of the last ones to be reviewed, to assess its architecture and cytology for evidence of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
