Both sections show a large, deeply infiltrating tumor, which appears as a dark, basophilic, and irregular mass disrupting the normal layered architecture of the bowel wall. The tumor appears to extend deep into the wall. Several round, purple structures resembling lymphoid aggregates are also visible within the bowel wall and possibly in the surrounding fatty tissue. The primary task here seems to be assessing the depth of invasion for T-staging."

Determining the relationship between the tumor and the muscularis propria is crucial for accurate T-staging. This view will help me assess whether the tumor is confined to the submucosa (pT1), invading the muscularis propria (pT2), or extending through the muscularis propria into the subserosal/pericolic tissue (pT3). The green box is positioned perfectly to evaluate this critical interface. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

On the right, there are irregular, back-to-back glandular structures with dark, atypical nuclei, which are characteristic of adenocarcinoma. On the left, there are bundles of eosinophilic (pink) smooth muscle, representing the muscularis propria. The malignant glands are clearly seen infiltrating between and disrupting the smooth muscle bundles, accompanied by an inflammatory and desmoplastic (fibrous) stromal reaction. My impression is that this is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that is actively invading the muscularis propria. This finding confirms a tumor stage of at least pT2."
