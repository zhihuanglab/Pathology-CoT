There are at least two main tissue pieces. The upper, larger piece contains a significant, irregular, and centrally located basophilic mass that appears to be infiltrating the surrounding fat. The lower piece also contains a similar, albeit smaller, nodular basophilic mass. These dark areas are highly suspicious for malignancy. This could represent the primary tumor with extratumoral extension and/or lymph nodes that have been replaced by metastatic tumor."

This region is intensely basophilic and has a complex, irregular architecture, making it the most likely location of the primary tumor. I would zoom into this area to confirm the histopathological diagnosis (i.e., adenocarcinoma), assess the tumor grade by examining the degree of glandular formation and cellular atypia, and look for specific features like necrosis, which are important for diagnosis and prognosis. This is a fundamental step in evaluating any cancer specimen. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The tumor cells exhibit marked pleomorphism, with enlarged, hyperchromatic, and elongated nuclei that have lost their basal polarity (stratification). A key finding is the presence of abundant intraluminal and stromal 'dirty necrosis,' which appears as eosinophilic granular debris mixed with inflammatory cells. Additionally, there is extensive hemorrhage (red areas) and coagulative necrosis (pink, acellular areas). My impression is that this is an invasive, moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The presence of prominent dirty necrosis is highly characteristic of a colorectal primary."
