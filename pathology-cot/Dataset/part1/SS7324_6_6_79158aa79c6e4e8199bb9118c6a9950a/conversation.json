The primary task is to identify metastatic disease in lymph nodes, so I must systematically examine every potential lymph node on the slide at high magnification. This is one of the several lymph nodes I need to assess. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is a clearly identifiable lymph node. In a colorectal cancer case, a crucial part of staging is to determine if the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes (N-staging). Therefore, every lymph node must be meticulously examined. This particular node is one of the larger and more well-circumscribed ones, making it a good candidate for initial detailed assessment. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to meticulously examine every single lymph node to determine the nodal status (pN stage). The area highlighted by the green box at the bottom right of the slide is a small, dark, basophilic focus. This appearance is highly suggestive of a lymph node or a fragment of lymphoid tissue. Even very small nodes must be assessed for metastasis. This is likely the 10th or 11th lymph node I would examine during a systematic, top-to-bottom, left-to-right review of the slide. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
