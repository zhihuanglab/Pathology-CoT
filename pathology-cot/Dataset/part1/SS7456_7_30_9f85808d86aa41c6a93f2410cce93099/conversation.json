I am zooming into the parenchyma of the largest lymph node on the left to systematically screen for evidence of metastasis. This specific area contains both the dense lymphoid tissue and the black pigment. It is important to carefully examine the cellular composition in these areas to ensure that the pigment is not obscuring nests of tumor cells and to differentiate between reactive changes (like sinus histiocytosis) and malignant infiltration. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, it is crucial to systematically examine every piece of tissue that could represent a lymph node to accurately stage the cancer. The green box is highlighting a smaller, distinct nodule of lymphoid tissue located between the two larger lymph nodes. This could be a small, separate lymph node or a fragment of a node. I would zoom into this area to assess it for the presence of metastatic tumor cells, as even a small focus of metastasis is clinically significant. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the second large lymph node from the left. I zoomed into this specific area at the periphery of the node because metastatic deposits from colorectal cancer often first appear in the subcapsular sinus. This region on the low-power view shows some textural and color variation, with areas of increased eosinophilia and congestion, warranting a closer look to rule out the presence of tumor cell nests among the lymphoid tissue and pigment. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the large lymph node on the right. This specific area is selected for high-power examination because it displays a heterogeneous pattern. It contains a mixture of the dense purple lymphoid tissue, black pigment, and some paler, less cellular areas. When screening for metastasis, it is crucial to investigate such interfaces and areas of architectural alteration. The goal is to determine if the paler areas represent benign reactive sinus histiocytosis or, more importantly, an infiltration of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
