It's also an area where early metastatic deposits in the subcapsular sinus can be found. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

These cells are infiltrating the adipose tissue, which is composed of large, clear fat cells (adipocytes). I do not see the typical features of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, such as malignant glands, large cells with irregular nuclei, or prominent pink cytoplasm. My impression of this specific field is that it represents lymphoid tissue, likely the edge of the lymph node parenchyma. While I would need to examine the entire node, this particular view does not show evidence of metastasis."
