It looks more like a piece of soft tissue, which in the context of a colorectal cancer resection, would be searched for lymph nodes or tumor deposits."

This specific area represents a focal point of interest that requires high-power examination for definitive characterization. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

This morphology is pathognomonic for a pilomatricoma, a benign adnexal tumor of hair matrix origin. The surrounding tissue consists of fibrous stroma, adipose tissue, and congested blood vessels. My impression is that this is an incidental finding of a pilomatricoma, likely from a skin/subcutaneous tissue sample taken during the surgery. There is no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma or lymph node tissue in this specific field of view."
