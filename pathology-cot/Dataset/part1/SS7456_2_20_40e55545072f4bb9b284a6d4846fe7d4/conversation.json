I am zooming into the main body (parenchyma) of this first lymph node to begin the assessment. The goal is to evaluate the overall cellular architecture and to look for any infiltration by non-lymphoid, atypical cells that would be indicative of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The largest lymph node on the far left is a logical starting point. The specific area highlighted by the green box is in the lower part of the node, potentially near the medullary or cortical sinuses. At low power, this area might have appeared more eosinophilic (pinker) or shown a subtle architectural disruption compared to the surrounding uniform lymphoid tissue, raising suspicion for infiltration by non-lymphoid, metastatic cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task for this case is to stage the cancer, which requires a thorough examination of all lymph nodes for metastasis. The green box is targeting one of the smaller lymph nodes in the central tissue block. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic review of all lymph nodes on the slide. The purpose is to assess the node's architecture at higher magnification, specifically to examine the subcapsular sinus and the lymphoid parenchyma for any clusters of atypical epithelial cells that would indicate metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. When assessing a colorectal cancer case for staging, a critical task is to meticulously search the pericolic fat for all lymph nodes and any suspicious cellular clusters. The area highlighted by the green box is a small, basophilic aggregate that could represent several possibilities: a very small lymph node, a benign lymphoid aggregate, or a tumor deposit (satellite nodule). It is essential to examine such foci at high power to differentiate between these possibilities, as identifying a tumor deposit would upstage the cancer (N-stage). This is part of the routine screening process of the pericolic fat. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
