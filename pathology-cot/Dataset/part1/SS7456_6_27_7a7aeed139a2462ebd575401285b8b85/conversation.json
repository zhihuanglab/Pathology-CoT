I am zooming into the superior-most of these two suspicious lymph nodes to confirm this impression. The purpose is to examine the cytological and architectural features of the infiltrating cells at high magnification to confirm they are malignant and consistent with adenocarcinoma from a colorectal primary. I also want to assess the extent of involvement and look for features like extranodal extension at the periphery of the node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the tumor deposit in the second lymph node (the one on the right). This specific location is crucial for several reasons: 1) to confirm the malignant nature of the infiltrating cells at high power, 2) to assess the interface between the tumor and the surrounding tissue, and most importantly, 3) to evaluate for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. The selected area is at the edge of the node, adjacent to fat, making it the ideal location to look for ENE. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the lower lymph node. This is a crucial area for assessing the lymph node capsule and the interface with the surrounding perinodal fat. The main reason is to look for evidence of extranodal extension (ENE), where the tumor breaks through the capsule and invades the adjacent soft tissue. The presence or absence of ENE is a critical prognostic factor and affects staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
