At low power, this region shows a focal area with a different texture and lighter staining compared to the surrounding dense lymphoid tissue. Such an area is highly suspicious for a metastatic deposit, as cancer cells often first seed the subcapsular sinus of a lymph node. It's crucial to examine any such architectural or cytological alteration at high magnification to rule metastasis in or out. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is part of the largest and most abnormal-appearing lymph node on the slide (the first prominent node from the left). At low power, the normal architecture of this node is effaced by pale, infiltrative-looking regions, which is a classic sign of metastasis. My goal is to examine these suspicious areas at high magnification to confirm the presence of non-lymphoid, malignant cells (i.e., carcinoma) and thereby classify this node as positive. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task for these tissue sections is to identify any lymph node metastasis, which is critical for staging the colorectal cancer. The green box is centered on the second large lymph node from the left. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic examination of every lymph node provided. The goal is to scrutinize the node's architecture, particularly the subcapsular sinus and the parenchyma, for any clusters of atypical epithelial cells that would indicate metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node for evidence of metastasis. I am zooming into this specific area, which corresponds to the third and smallest of the main lymph nodes, because it appears entirely replaced by abnormal cellular infiltrates. The normal sinusoids and follicular structures are not discernible at low power, raising a strong suspicion of complete effacement by tumor, which requires confirmation at high power. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

They are arranged in cohesive nests and glandular-like structures. This cluster of atypical epithelial cells within the lymphoid parenchyma is diagnostic of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

These malignant cells are large, have pleomorphic nuclei with irregular contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, and possess a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.
