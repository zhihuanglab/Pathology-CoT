I can identify several potential lymph nodes of varying sizes.

There are other smaller, discrete nodules scattered throughout the adipose tissue that also require examination."

The area highlighted by the green box contains a small, discrete, basophilic nodule located within the adipose tissue. At low power, this could represent a small lymph node, a tumor deposit (satellite nodule), or a benign aggregate of lymphocytes. It is crucial to examine any such suspicious focus at high magnification to determine its exact nature and to rule in or out the presence of metastatic carcinoma, which is essential for accurate N-staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is a discrete, highly cellular, basophilic nodule embedded in fat, which is the classic appearance of a lymph node at low magnification. The dark and somewhat irregular appearance raises suspicion for either metastatic disease replacing the normal lymphoid tissue or significant reactive changes. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to identify all lymph nodes and determine if they contain cancer, which is crucial for staging. This is one of the most suspicious-looking potential lymph nodes on the slide, making it a high-priority area to examine at high power. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There is also a significant desmoplastic stromal reaction (fibrous tissue) and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the tumor nests. On the left, there is an area of tumor necrosis. My impression is a lymph node positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with an origin from a colorectal primary."
