A significant portion is composed of a densely cellular, basophilic area, which is highly suspicious for a malignant tumor. This tumor appears to be infiltrating into the surrounding pinkish stromal and white adipose tissue. In the upper left quadrant, there is a distinct, well-circumscribed, ovoid structure consistent with a lymph node. My first impression is that this slide contains the primary colorectal tumor and at least one regional lymph node, requiring evaluation for tumor characteristics and metastasis."

This area is ideal for characterizing the primary tumor itself before moving on to assess the lymph nodes or the invasion depth. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The tumor cells exhibit significant pleomorphism, with large, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. A key feature is the presence of central, eosinophilic, granular debris within the tumor nests, which is characteristic of 'dirty necrosis' or comedonecrosis. My impression is that this is an invasive adenocarcinoma, consistent with a colorectal primary. The presence of solid sheets and prominent necrosis suggests a moderately to poorly differentiated tumor."
