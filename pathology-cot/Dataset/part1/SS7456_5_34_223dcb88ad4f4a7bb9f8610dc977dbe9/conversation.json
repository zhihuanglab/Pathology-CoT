When staging colorectal cancer, it is crucial to meticulously examine every lymph node to determine if cancer has spread (N staging). This particular node, being the first one from the bottom left, is a logical starting point for the microscopic examination to search for metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is centered on a basophilic, cellular area within the largest tissue fragment, which is characteristic of a lymph node. As a pathologist staging a colorectal cancer case, my primary objective here is to determine the nodal (N) stage. This requires a thorough microscopic examination of every lymph node to identify any metastatic tumor deposits. I am zooming into this specific lymph node (the first one in the largest tissue piece) to assess its architecture and search for atypical epithelial cells that would indicate metastasis from the primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it contains a dense, basophilic (dark purple) cellular aggregate. At low power, such areas are highly suspicious for either being a lymph node or a tumor deposit. In a lymph node dissection specimen for colorectal cancer, identifying all lymphoid tissue is critical. This specific dark area needs to be examined at high magnification to first confirm if it is a lymph node and, more importantly, to meticulously search for atypical epithelial cells that would indicate metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There are no definitive features of metastatic carcinoma in this specific field of view, such as atypical glands, large pleomorphic cells, or signet ring cells.
