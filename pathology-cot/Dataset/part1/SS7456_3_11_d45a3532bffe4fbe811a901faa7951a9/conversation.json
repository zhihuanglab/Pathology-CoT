The area in the green box is a well-defined, densely cellular nodule, which is clearly a lymph node. I am starting my examination with this node (the uppermost on the left) to assess its architecture and search for any atypical cells that would indicate a tumor deposit. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it represents a discrete, highly cellular, basophilic tissue fragment consistent with a lymph node. In the context of staging for colorectal cancer, it is critical to examine every potential lymph node to look for evidence of metastasis. This fragment is one of several potential lymph nodes on the slide that requires careful, high-magnification review. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is part of the largest and most cellular-appearing lymph node on the slide, located at the top right. This node appears architecturally abnormal from low power, with dense, dark staining. The specific area of the zoom is at the edge of the lymphoid tissue, which is a critical region to examine for early metastatic deposits that may first arrive in the subcapsular sinus. A systematic, high-power examination of all nodes is required, and starting with the most suspicious-looking one is a common and efficient approach. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the largest lymph node candidate, located in the upper right portion of the slide. This structure is highly cellular and shows an irregular, dark staining pattern, which is suspicious. The green box is placed at the periphery of the lymphoid tissue, near the capsule and adjacent structures. This subcapsular sinus area is a common initial site for metastatic cells to deposit. Therefore, examining this region is a high-priority step in the process of screening for lymph node metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

At the bottom, there is mature adipose tissue. Within this dense lymphoid population, I do not see any clear evidence of metastatic carcinoma, such as distinct nests of larger epithelial cells, gland formation, or significant nuclear pleomorphism typical of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The impression from this specific field is that of a lymph node completely replaced by a small lymphocytic infiltrate, which could be an incidental finding of a low-grade lymphoma (like CLL/SLL) or an unusual reactive pattern. Based on this view, it is negative for metastatic carcinoma, but the entire node must be examined carefully."
