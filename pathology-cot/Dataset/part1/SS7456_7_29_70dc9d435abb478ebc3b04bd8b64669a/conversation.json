I am zooming into this specific area because it represents one of the lymph nodes, located in the upper-left portion of the slide. This is the starting point of my systematic review of all the lymph nodes present on the slide to determine the N stage. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. The green box highlights one of the smaller, well-circumscribed lymph nodes located in the upper left quadrant (the third distinct node from the top-left). I am zooming into this area to assess its architecture at higher magnification. Specifically, I am examining the subcapsular sinus and the parenchyma to look for any infiltration by atypical epithelial cells, which would indicate metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol for a cancer case is to meticulously examine every single lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The green box is placed over one of the larger, centrally located lymph nodes. I would zoom into this specific area as part of a systematic review of all the nodes on the slide. This particular node appears to have some textural variation at low power, which warrants closer inspection at higher magnification to assess its architecture and to search for any atypical cell clusters or glandular formations indicative of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic examination of all lymph nodes on the slide. This particular node, located centrally, is one of the larger ones present, making it a high-priority target for evaluation. Its dense and uniform cellularity at low power necessitates a closer look to assess the architecture and cell types. The goal is to carefully screen for any non-lymphoid cell clusters that would indicate metastatic carcinoma, which can sometimes be subtle. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically evaluate every piece of tissue that could be a lymph node to search for metastasis. The area highlighted by the green box is one of the smaller, distinct tissue nodules located in the lower-central part of the slide. It's essential to examine every node, regardless of its size. I would zoom into this area to confirm it is indeed lymphoid tissue and to meticulously inspect its architecture and cellular components for any atypical cells or features suggestive of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide to look for evidence of metastasis. The selected area of interest is one of these lymph nodes (approximately the fourth major node from the top, in the right-central part of the slide). This particular node is located adjacent to an area of blue surgical ink, which always requires careful inspection. Furthermore, even at low power, the node appears to have some architectural irregularities and darker pigmentation, which warrants a closer look to rule out metastasis or other pathology. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. When evaluating a case for lymph node metastasis, it is standard practice to systematically examine every single lymph node identified. The pathologist has zoomed into this area at the bottom right because it is one of the lymph nodes that needs to be assessed. There is nothing uniquely suspicious about this particular node from the low-power view; this is simply part of a methodical, comprehensive examination of all submitted lymph nodes to ensure none are missed. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically review every lymph node on the slide. The green box is positioned on one of the lymph nodes located in the lower right quadrant. This node appears densely cellular and solid. My reason for zooming in is to perform a high-power examination of this specific lymph node to assess its architecture and cellular components for any evidence of metastatic tumor cells, which is a critical part of staging the cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically examine every lymph node on the slide to determine if cancer has spread. The area indicated by the green box contains one of the smaller lymph nodes, located at the bottom right of the image (it's the second node from the right on the bottom row). Even if a lymph node appears normal at low magnification, it must be carefully inspected at high power to rule out the presence of micrometastases or isolated tumor cells, which can be subtle. This zoom is part of that routine, systematic screening process. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As part of the staging process for colorectal cancer, every lymph node must be meticulously examined for evidence of metastasis. The selected area is one of these lymph nodes. I am systematically reviewing each node on the slide, and this is one in the sequence (the lymph node in the upper right). At low power, its overall shape and color warrant closer inspection to differentiate between reactive changes, pigment deposition, and potential metastatic tumor deposits. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol is to systematically examine every piece of tissue that represents a lymph node. The area selected for zoom is one of these lymph nodes, located on the right side of the slide. In the low-power view, this node appears partially effaced. There is a dense, dark purple area, likely residual lymphoid tissue, but also a significant portion that is paler and has a more disorganized texture. This irregular interface is a key feature that warrants high-magnification review to determine if the paler area is a normal fatty hilum, a reactive process, or, more likely, an infiltration by metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each piece of tissue that resembles a lymph node. The area indicated by the green box is one of these lymph nodes, specifically the most prominent one on the far left side of the slide. I would zoom into this area to assess its architecture and cellular detail at high magnification, looking for any abnormal cell clusters, glandular structures, or other features that would indicate the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma, which is the key task for a lymph node slide in a colorectal cancer case. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to meticulously examine every lymph node on the slide to screen for metastasis. The green box is placed on the second lymph node from the top-left. I would zoom into this area as part of my systematic review. At low power, this particular node appears somewhat irregular and has a heterogeneous texture with paler areas, which raises suspicion for the replacement of normal lymphoid tissue by a tumor deposit, prompting a high-magnification look. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my standard procedure for staging colorectal cancer is to meticulously examine every single lymph node identified in the specimen. The area highlighted by the green box contains one of these lymph nodes, located in the lower right quadrant. I would zoom into this area as part of my systematic review of all nodes to assess it at high magnification. The goal is to carefully search for any evidence of metastatic carcinoma, which would appear as clusters of atypical epithelial cells, often forming glands, that are foreign to the normal lymph node architecture. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The presence of glands within a lymph node in the context of colorectal cancer raises suspicion for metastatic adenocarcinoma. However, the bland appearance of these glands is also highly suggestive of benign nodal inclusions (ectopic glands). At this point, this node is suspicious but likely negative for malignancy.

The alveolar walls are heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes, and there are black pigment deposits, which is anthracotic pigment (carbon). My impression is that this is an intrapulmonary lymph node or a hilar lymph node directly adjacent to lung tissue. The primary finding here is the juxtaposition of lung tissue and a lymph node, with the lung showing a marked lymphocytic infiltrate. In this particular field, there are no clear signs of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The finding of lung tissue is unusual for a standard colorectal cancer resection, suggesting this might be from a lung metastasis resection or a more extensive dissection."

The lymphoid tissue appears reactive, but I do not see definitive clusters of malignant epithelial cells in this field of view. My impression is a reactive lymph node with extensive iatrogenic pigment deposition. The entire node must be examined to definitively rule out metastasis."
