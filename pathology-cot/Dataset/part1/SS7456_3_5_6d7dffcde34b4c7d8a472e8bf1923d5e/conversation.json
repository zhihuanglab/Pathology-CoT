The intensely basophilic (dark purple) area on the lower left represents the adenocarcinoma, which appears to be large and fungating. The tumor seems to be deeply invasive, extending through the colonic wall (pink layers) and into the adjacent pericolic adipose tissue (pale, web-like area on the right). There are a few smaller, separate tissue fragments that could represent lymph nodes. The primary task on this slide would be to determine the depth of invasion for T-staging."

The lower portion is heavily infiltrated by malignant glandular cells, consistent with adenocarcinoma. These tumor cells are characterized by large, hyperchromatic nuclei and are associated with a dense inflammatory and desmoplastic stromal reaction. The upper portion consists of thick, eosinophilic bundles of smooth muscle, which represents the muscularis propria. The adenocarcinoma is unequivocally seen infiltrating and disrupting these smooth muscle bundles. This finding confirms invasion into the muscularis propria, making the tumor at least a T2 stage. I would continue to scan along this invasive front to determine if there is extension beyond the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat."
