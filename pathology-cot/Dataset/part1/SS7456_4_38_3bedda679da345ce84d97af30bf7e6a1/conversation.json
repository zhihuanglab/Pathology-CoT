The bulk of the tumor is intensely basophilic, suggesting high cellularity. In the bottom right corner, there is a separate, well-circumscribed, ovoid structure with a basophilic cortex and lighter medulla, which is characteristic of a lymph node. My initial task would be to assess the primary tumor for depth of invasion (T stage) and to examine the separate lymph node for metastasis (N stage)."

This location is within the main body of the tumor and appears representative of its architecture. The purpose is to confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, evaluate its differentiation (how well it forms glands), and assess the cytologic atypia (irregularity of the nuclei, mitotic activity). This detailed examination is crucial for grading the tumor and understanding its morphology before I proceed to find the deepest point of invasion into the bowel wall to determine the T stage. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The neoplastic cells forming these glands exhibit significant atypia, characterized by enlarged, hyperchromatic, and elongated (pencil-shaped) nuclei that are pseudostratified. There is a loss of normal crypt architecture. The stroma between the glands appears desmoplastic. These features are characteristic of a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma. The glandular formation is still apparent, but it is highly disorganized and infiltrative."
