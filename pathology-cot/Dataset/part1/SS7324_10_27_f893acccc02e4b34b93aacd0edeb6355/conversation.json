Many of these nodules are clearly infiltrated or replaced by tumor, which appears as basophilic (purple) cellular areas, often associated with large, pale, acellular pools of mucin. The overall pattern is highly suggestive of an invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma with extensive spread into the surrounding soft tissue. These nodules could represent either metastatic lymph nodes or extranodal tumor deposits. I can identify at least 10-15 such nodules."

Examining this area at high power is essential to confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, assess its histological grade by evaluating the glandular architecture and cytologic features, and look for specific prognostic markers like tumor budding or perineural invasion. Furthermore, I would carefully inspect the periphery of this nodule for any remnants of lymph node tissue (e.g., a capsule or lymphoid follicles) to determine if this is a positive lymph node versus an extranodal tumor deposit, which is critical for staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

I see complex, cribriform, and back-to-back glandular structures lined by atypical columnar epithelial cells. These cells show nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and loss of polarity. Some of the glandular lumens contain necrotic debris, a feature characteristic of colorectal adenocarcinoma ('dirty necrosis'). The surrounding stroma is desmoplastic and infiltrated by a prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. My impression is a definite focus of invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma within what is likely a metastatic lymph node or an extranodal tumor deposit."
