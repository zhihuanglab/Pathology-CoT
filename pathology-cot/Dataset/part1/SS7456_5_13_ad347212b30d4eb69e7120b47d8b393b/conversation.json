The area highlighted by the green box contains one of these well-defined, basophilic structures characteristic of a lymph node. I am zooming in to assess its architecture and cellular details at higher magnification to determine if it is benign or contains malignant cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. When screening a lymph node dissection for colorectal cancer, any discrete, cellular, and basophilic (darkly stained) nodule within the adipose tissue is highly suspicious for metastatic disease. The area highlighted by the green box is one such focus. It stands out from the surrounding pale fatty tissue due to its high cellularity and distinct borders. It is imperative to examine such areas at high magnification to determine if they represent a lymph node with metastasis, a tumor deposit (which also affects staging), or a benign finding. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glands are irregular in shape and size, and are lined by crowded, dark, elongated (hyperchromatic and pleomorphic) nuclei, which is characteristic of adenocarcinoma. There is no definite residual lymph node architecture (like lymphoid follicles or a subcapsular sinus) visible in this field. Therefore, my impression is that this is a focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma. This could represent either a lymph node that has been completely replaced by tumor, or a 'tumor deposit' (TD) in the pericolic fat. This is a positive finding and is critical for cancer staging (pN)."
