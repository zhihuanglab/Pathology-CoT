The larger fragment on the left appears to be a cross-section of the colon wall, extensively infiltrated by a large, basophilic (dark purple) tumor. The tumor seems to invade deeply through the layers of the bowel wall. The fragment on the right consists mainly of adipose tissue (fat), likely pericolic fat, which contains several potential lymph nodes and blood vessels. The overall impression is of a large primary colorectal tumor and associated fatty tissue for lymph node evaluation."

I would zoom into this area to confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, assess its histological grade (how well or poorly the tumor forms glands), and evaluate the depth of invasion into the bowel wall, which is critical for determining the T stage. This area is also ideal for looking for other important prognostic features such as lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glands are irregular, crowded, and vary in size and shape, often with a back-to-back arrangement. The neoplastic cells lining these glands show significant atypia, including enlarged, hyperchromatic (darkly stained), and pleomorphic nuclei with loss of normal polarity. There is some luminal debris. My impression is that this is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, confirming the malignant nature of the lesion seen at low power."
