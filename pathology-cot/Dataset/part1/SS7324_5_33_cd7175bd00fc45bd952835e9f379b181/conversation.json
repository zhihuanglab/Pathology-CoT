There is extensive infiltration by a basophilic (dark purple) malignant process, forming irregular glands that replace the normal tissue architecture. The tumor appears to be deeply invasive, extending through the full thickness of the bowel wall (which is partially represented) and into the surrounding pericolic fibroadipose tissue, suggesting an advanced T stage (at least T3). No distinct, encapsulated lymph nodes are clearly identifiable in this section; it appears to be a section of the primary tumor itself. The overall impression is of a large, deeply invasive adenocarcinoma."

This is a critical area to examine for several reasons: \n1. To assess the tumor grade by evaluating the degree of glandular formation.\n2. To look for high-risk prognostic features such as tumor budding (small clusters of tumor cells detaching from the main tumor) and perineural invasion.\n3. To search for lymphovascular invasion (LVI), which is the presence of tumor cells within endothelial-lined channels. \n4. To evaluate the nature of the stromal response to the tumor (e.g., desmoplastic, inflammatory). All these features are crucial for determining the patient's prognosis and guiding further treatment. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it represents the deepest point of invasion, the leading edge of the tumor. This is the most critical area for determining the T-stage of the cancer. Examining this interface between the main tumor mass and the surrounding soft tissue is essential to confirm invasion into the subserosal adipose tissue (T3 stage) and to look for other poor prognostic features such as tumor budding (small clusters of cancer cells), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI), which are often most evident at the infiltrative front. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glandular epithelial cells show marked nuclear atypia, including enlargement, hyperchromasia (dark staining), pleomorphism (variation in size and shape), and loss of normal polarity. Mitotic figures are likely present but not clearly discernible in this static image. There is also a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the stroma. My impression is of an invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The presence of smaller glandular structures and single cells at the edge of larger glands is suspicious for tumor budding, a poor prognostic indicator."

There is a significant inflammatory infiltrate mixed with the tumor cells. Some small, dark purple, amorphous calcifications are also present. The key finding is the presence of small clusters and single atypical glands, which is highly suggestive of tumor budding. My impression is that this confirms an invasive adenocarcinoma with a desmoplastic response and features concerning for high-grade tumor budding, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. This view helps confirm the invasive nature of the tumor, which is critical for staging."
