The irregular contour raises suspicion for potential tumor infiltration disrupting the normal architecture or extranodal extension. The selected area is specifically at the periphery of the node, which is a critical location to examine for tumor cells in the subcapsular sinus and to assess the integrity of the lymph node capsule. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the largest lymph node on the left side of the image. The specific area of interest is the periphery of the node, where the lymphoid tissue meets the surrounding pericolic fat. This lymph node appears irregular and possibly fragmented. Examining the capsule and the interface with the fat is crucial to assess for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding soft tissue. ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor, so any irregularity at the node's border must be carefully evaluated. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node to check for signs of metastasis. The green box is located on the second lymph node from the top left. This node appears somewhat fragmented and irregular in shape. I am zooming into this specific area to assess the cellular composition and architecture of the lymph node parenchyma, looking for any atypical cells, abnormal glandular structures, or disruption of the normal nodal architecture that would suggest the presence of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node submitted. The green box is focused on one of the smaller lymph nodes in the upper left. I would zoom into this area to assess its architecture and cytology at high magnification. Specifically, I am looking for evidence of metastasis, which often begins in the subcapsular sinus at the periphery of the node. This location is also critical for assessing extranodal extension (tumor spreading into the surrounding fat), which is an important prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my procedure is to examine every lymph node on the slide to determine if cancer has spread. The green box highlights one of the lymph nodes, specifically the one in the upper right quadrant of the image. I am zooming into this area to perform a high-magnification assessment of its architecture and cellular composition. I need to carefully inspect the subcapsular sinus and the parenchyma for any atypical cells or glandular structures that would indicate metastasis from the primary colorectal cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node present on the slide. The green box is placed on one of the smaller lymph nodes on the right side of the image. I am zooming into this specific lymph node to assess its architecture, including the cortex, paracortex, medulla, and sinuses, to search for any atypical cells or clusters of cells that would indicate metastatic adenocarcinoma.

A key finding is that these lymphoid cells are infiltrating into the surrounding adipose tissue, breaking through the lymph node capsule. This feature is known as extranodal extension. In the context of colorectal cancer, the primary goal is to find metastatic adenocarcinoma cells (glandular structures). While I do not see definite malignant glands in this specific field of view, the complete effacement of the node architecture and the presence of extranodal extension are highly suspicious for malignancy.
