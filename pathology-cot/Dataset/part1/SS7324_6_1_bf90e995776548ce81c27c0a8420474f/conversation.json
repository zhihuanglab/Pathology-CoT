Its uniformly dark, hypercellular appearance is highly abnormal and raises strong suspicion for complete replacement by tumor, as opposed to a reactive process which often preserves some architecture. It's crucial to examine such suspicious nodes at high power to look for metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node to check for metastasis. I chose to zoom into this central lymph node because its irregular contour and non-uniform, mottled basophilic staining at low power are suspicious features. These features suggest that the normal lymph node architecture might be effaced or replaced by an infiltrating process, such as a metastatic tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
