I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it is clearly a lymph node, and a systematic evaluation of all lymph nodes is crucial for cancer staging. This particular node is one of the largest and most well-preserved on the slide, making it a good starting point for examination. The goal is to carefully inspect the architecture, looking for any evidence of metastatic tumor cells, particularly in the subcapsular sinus and throughout the lymphoid parenchyma.
