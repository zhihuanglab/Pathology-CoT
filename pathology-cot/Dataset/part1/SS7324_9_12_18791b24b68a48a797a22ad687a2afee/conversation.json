One large, elongated fragment on the lower left is particularly prominent. It is intensely basophilic (dark purple) with a large, central, bright pink (eosinophilic) area, which is highly suspicious for a lymph node largely replaced by metastatic carcinoma with central necrosis or mucin production. The other tissue fragments are smaller and paler, likely containing adipose tissue and possibly smaller, negative lymph nodes."

My immediate goal is to confirm the presence of metastasis and, crucially, to assess for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. ENE is a critical prognostic factor. The zoomed-in area is located at the periphery of the lymph node, at the interface between the tumor, the lymph node capsule, and the adjacent fatty tissue. This is the precise location to evaluate for a breach of the capsule and invasion into the surrounding fat. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is located within what I suspect is the largest lymph node on the slide. In a colorectal cancer case, the primary task for lymph nodes is to identify metastases. The selected area is markedly basophilic and appears more cellularly dense compared to the expected architecture of a normal lymph node, making it a high-priority region to investigate for the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The tumor consists of irregular nests and sheets of malignant cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. A thickened, fibrous lymph node capsule is visible. The key finding is that nests of tumor cells are clearly seen extending beyond the contour of the lymph node capsule and infiltrating into the surrounding pericapsular connective and adipose tissue. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node with definite evidence of extranodal extension (ENE)."

This morphology is not consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, which would typically form glands. Instead, the findings are diagnostic of a benign epidermoid cyst (or keratinous cyst). This is an incidental, benign finding within or adjacent to the lymph node."
