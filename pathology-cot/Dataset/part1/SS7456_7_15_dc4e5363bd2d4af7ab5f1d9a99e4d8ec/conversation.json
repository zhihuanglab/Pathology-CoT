Within these tissue fragments, there are several nodular structures of varying sizes. These are consistent with lymph nodes. The most prominent structure is a large, basophilic (dark purple) and well-circumscribed node in the lower right, which is highly suspicious for being a lymph node completely replaced by metastatic tumor. Another smaller, but still distinct, lymph node is visible in the upper left tissue fragment. Other smaller potential lymph nodes and vascular structures are also present. The overall impression is of a lymph node dissection for staging colorectal cancer, with at least one grossly positive node."

While the large node in the lower right is almost certainly positive, I must systematically screen all tissue for other, smaller nodes. The area highlighted by the green box contains a small, basophilic (cellular) aggregate within the fat, which is suspicious for being another lymph node. Therefore, I am zooming in to confirm if it is indeed a lymph node and to meticulously search for any evidence of metastatic carcinoma, no matter how small. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to identify all positive lymph nodes, not just the obviously involved ones. The green box is placed on a small, basophilic aggregate in the upper-left tissue fragment. This area represents a potential small lymph node or a lymphoid aggregate that must be carefully examined. Even if a case has a grossly positive node, it's crucial to assess all other nodes for micrometastases or isolated tumor cells, as the total number of positive nodes is a key prognostic factor (part of the N stage). I am zooming in to confirm if this is lymphoid tissue and to meticulously search for any atypical epithelial cells (metastatic carcinoma). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is centered on the first lymph node from the top left. At low power, this node contains a focal, dense, and basophilic (dark purple) area that appears distinct from the surrounding lymphoid tissue. This appearance is highly suspicious for a metastatic deposit, which often disrupts the normal architecture of the lymph node. I would zoom into this specific area to examine the cytology of these cells and confirm whether they are malignant epithelial cells, thus confirming this as a positive lymph node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the larger, more suspicious lymph node located in the bottom-right tissue fragment. The lymph node architecture appears almost completely effaced and replaced by a basophilic tumor. This is a critical area to examine to confirm the presence and extent of metastasis. The purpose of zooming in is to verify the malignant nature of the cells and assess for features like extranodal extension, which is crucial for staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
