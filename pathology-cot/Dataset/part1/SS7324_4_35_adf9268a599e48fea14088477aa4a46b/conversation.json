I can see some variation in the pattern, with follicular structures present. Crucially, I do not see any obvious signs of metastasis in this specific field, such as atypical glandular structures, clusters of large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, or mucin pools that would be expected with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. My impression of this specific area is that it is a benign, possibly reactive, lymph node. I would still need to scan the entire node at this magnification to rule out small tumor deposits (micrometastases)."
