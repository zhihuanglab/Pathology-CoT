Tumor cells from a primary colorectal cancer typically travel through lymphatic vessels and first deposit in the subcapsular sinus of a lymph node. Therefore, the periphery, just under the capsule, is the most critical area to examine for early metastatic deposits. This represents a systematic approach to screening the lymph node for positivity. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist evaluating lymph nodes for colorectal cancer staging, the primary goal is to identify metastatic tumor cells. I am systematically examining all the lymph nodes provided. I chose to zoom into this specific area of the rightmost lymph node because it appears architecturally distorted and has prominent dark, discolored patches on the low-power view. Any area that deviates from the normal, homogeneous appearance of a lymph node is a prime target for investigation, as it could represent metastasis, necrosis, or other significant pathology. This is the most abnormal-looking area on the slide. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would zoom into this area because it represents one of the potential lymph nodes that needs to be examined. This is the second and smallest of the three main lymph node-like structures from the left. It is standard practice to systematically evaluate every piece of tissue submitted as a lymph node at high magnification to definitively rule in or rule out the presence of metastatic tumor cells, regardless of the node's size or low-power appearance. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The surrounding lymphoid tissue appears reactive. Crucially, I do not see any definitive nests of atypical epithelial cells or malignant glands that would indicate metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression of this specific field is marked anthracosis and reactive sinus histiocytosis, which is a benign finding.
