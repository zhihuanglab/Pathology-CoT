The green box is placed over the first identifiable lymph node from the top-left of the slide. Zooming into this area is a standard step to evaluate its architecture and cellular components at high magnification to rule out or confirm the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary goal in a colorectal cancer resection is to stage the tumor, which includes assessing the lymph nodes for metastasis (N stage). The green box is placed directly on one of the most prominent lymph nodes visible at low power (the one on the left). It is standard practice to systematically examine every lymph node at high magnification to screen for metastatic tumor cells, which can be present as small clusters in the subcapsular sinus or as larger deposits that efface the normal nodal architecture. This is a critical step in the diagnostic process. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the primary task for this type of specimen is to identify any lymph nodes containing metastatic tumor cells. The area indicated by the green box clearly contains one of the lymph nodes present on the slide. I would zoom into this area to begin the systematic high-power examination of each lymph node to assess its architecture and cellular composition, specifically searching for clusters of atypical epithelial cells that would indicate metastasis from a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the area at the interface between the second lymph node (the one on the lower right) and the adjacent perinodal adipose tissue. This is a critical location to examine for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the spread of metastatic tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat. The presence of ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor and needs to be carefully assessed and reported. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it contains one of the two distinct lymph nodes visible at low power (the one in the lower-right). It is standard practice to examine every identified lymph node at high magnification to screen for metastatic tumor cells. This particular node appears densely cellular, raising suspicion for either significant reactive changes or metastasis, making it a high-priority area to investigate. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. The zoom area is focused on the second of the two visible lymph nodes, specifically at its periphery. This is a critical region to examine because the subcapsular sinus is the initial site where metastatic cells often deposit. Furthermore, assessing the interface between the lymph node capsule and the surrounding fat is essential to determine if there is extranodal extension (ENE), which is a key prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
