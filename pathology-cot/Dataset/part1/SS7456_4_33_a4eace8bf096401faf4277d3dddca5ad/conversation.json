The location is at the periphery of the node, at the interface between the lymphoid tissue, the lymph node capsule, and the surrounding perinodal fat. This is a critical region to scrutinize because metastatic carcinoma cells typically arrive in the lymph node via afferent lymphatic vessels and first deposit in the subcapsular sinus. Therefore, a thorough examination of the entire subcapsular sinus is essential to detect early metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

Within the fibrous capsule and extending into the surrounding fat, there are small, irregular nests and individual atypical cells. These cells are larger than the surrounding lymphocytes, have more eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm, and pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. These features are characteristic of metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node containing metastatic carcinoma with evidence of extranodal extension (tumor cells in the perinodal adipose tissue)."
