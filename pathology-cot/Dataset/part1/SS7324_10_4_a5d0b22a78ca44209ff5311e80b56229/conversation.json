It is standard practice to start at one end of the slide and review each piece of tissue sequentially. This area is zoomed into to begin the evaluation of this specific lymph node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The zoomed-in area, indicated by the green box, is not located within one of the main, obvious lymph nodes but rather in the surrounding adipose (fatty) tissue. I would zoom into this specific area because it's crucial to meticulously scan the fat for small, subtle findings that can be easily missed at low power. These include: 1) tiny, microscopic lymph nodes, 2) isolated tumor deposits (which have prognostic significance, pN1c), and 3) lymphovascular invasion. The area in the box appears slightly more cellular or texturally different from the uniform fat around it, which is a key signal to investigate further at high magnification to rule out malignancy. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol is to examine every lymph node submitted. The green box is focused on the third lymph node from the top on the left side. I would zoom into this specific area because the normal, dense lymphoid architecture appears to be disrupted and replaced by a paler, more eosinophilic-looking tissue at the edge. This change in color and texture is highly suspicious for a metastatic deposit, which often begins in the subcapsular sinus and periphery of the node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is part of a systematic examination of all submitted tissue fragments. This specific fragment, which is the fifth distinct piece of tissue from the top, appears somewhat irregular and fragmented even at low power. It's crucial to examine every piece of tissue, including small fragments and those largely replaced by fat, as they can harbor micrometastases or isolated tumor cells. The slightly darker, more disorganized region within this fragment warrants high-magnification inspection to rule out or confirm the presence of tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The green box is placed on the second lymph node from the top in the right-hand column. I would zoom into this area as part of a comprehensive, methodical scan of this specific node. This area appears to be a cellular part of the node's cortex, which is a critical region to assess for both normal lymphoid architecture and the presence of infiltrating tumor cells. I would start here and then pan across the entire node, paying close attention to the subcapsular sinus. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic review of all submitted lymph nodes. This specific area is the fifth and lowermost tissue fragment from the top. At low magnification, the border of the lymphoid tissue looks irregular and seems to be indistinctly merging with the surrounding fat. This is a suspicious feature for tumor infiltration through the lymph node capsule and into the perinodal fat, which requires high-power examination. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is part of a large, well-circumscribed lymph node (the second distinct node from the top). When staging a cancer, it is crucial to systematically examine every lymph node at higher magnification. This specific area is part of that systematic review to meticulously search for any non-native cells, such as clusters of atypical epithelial cells, that would indicate a metastatic deposit from the primary colorectal carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
