The majority of the tissue is replaced by a large, irregular, and deeply basophilic (purple) mass, consistent with an infiltrative malignant tumor. Remnants of the normal colonic wall, including mucosa and muscularis, can be seen at the periphery. I do not see any distinct, encapsulated lymph nodes in this thumbnail; it appears to be a section of the primary tumor. My initial impression is that this is an advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma."

This high-power view is essential to confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and to assess its histological grade. I need to evaluate the glandular architecture (e.g., cribriforming, degree of gland formation), cytologic atypia, and mitotic activity. This area is also suitable for checking for features like tumor necrosis, which is evident here. While determining the T stage requires examining the deepest point of invasion, characterizing the tumor itself, as done in this view, is a fundamental first step. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glands exhibit a cribriform architecture and are back-to-back with little intervening stroma. The tumor cells have enlarged, hyperchromatic, and pleomorphic nuclei. A prominent feature is the presence of intraluminal necrotic debris, often referred to as 'dirty necrosis.' The surrounding stroma is desmoplastic and contains a significant inflammatory infiltrate. My impression is that this is a moderately to poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin."
