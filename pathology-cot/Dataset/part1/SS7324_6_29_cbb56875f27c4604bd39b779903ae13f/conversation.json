There is a prominent, bulky, and irregularly shaped tumor that is intensely basophilic (purple), indicating it is highly cellular. This tumor appears to arise from the mucosa and massively expands it, forming a large polypoid and ulcerative mass. The tumor seems to be invading into the deeper layers of the colon wall. The pink layer at the bottom is the muscularis propria. I do not see any separate, discrete lymph nodes in this tissue section; the focus is on the primary tumor."

I would zoom here to assess the fundamental characteristics of the cancer, such as its architectural pattern (gland formation) and cytologic features (nuclear atypia, mitotic activity). This detailed examination is crucial to confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and to determine its histological grade (e.g., well, moderately, or poorly differentiated), which is an important prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glands are lined by atypical columnar cells with enlarged, elongated, hyperchromatic, and stratified nuclei. There is a loss of normal architecture, with back-to-back and cribriform (sieve-like) patterns. There is also associated stromal reaction and some hemorrhage. My impression is that this is a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon. The area at the bottom shows some detached tumor fragments and debris, possibly from an ulcerated surface."
