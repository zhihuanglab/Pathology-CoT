The superior (top) piece is a well-defined, ovoid, and densely basophilic (purple) structure, which is characteristic of a lymph node. Below it is a smaller, more irregularly shaped fragment of tissue, which could be another lymph node or fibro-adipose tissue. My first impression is that this is a lymph node dissection slide, and the main task will be to assess the lymph nodes for metastatic cancer."

Metastatic cancer cells from a primary tumor typically travel through the lymphatic vessels and first lodge in the subcapsular sinus, which is located just beneath the lymph node capsule at the periphery. Therefore, carefully examining the entire periphery of the lymph node is the most critical and highest-yield step in screening for metastatic deposits, especially for small or early metastases. This is the first lymph node from the top being examined. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

These cells are supported by a fine pink fibrous stroma. I do not see any definitive evidence of malignancy in this particular field. There are no atypical glandular formations, no clusters of large pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli, and no extracellular mucin, which would be features of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. My impression of this specific area is that it represents benign lymphoid tissue, likely a normal or reactive lymph node cortex. The next step would be to continue systematically scanning the entire periphery and then the center of the node to rule out metastasis elsewhere."
