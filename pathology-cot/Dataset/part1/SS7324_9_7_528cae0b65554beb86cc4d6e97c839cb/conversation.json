The tumor appears glandular and is stained dark purple, indicating a high density of cells. The growth pattern is infiltrative and disorganized, characteristic of an adenocarcinoma. At the top, there are separate, smaller fragments of tissue which could be lymph nodes or parts of the resection margin. My initial impression is of a large, invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma."

This area seems representative of the invasive component of the tumor, making it ideal for detailed morphological evaluation. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The glands are irregularly shaped, crowded, and lined by stratified, pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. A key feature is the presence of abundant intraluminal necrotic debris, often termed 'dirty necrosis', which is highly characteristic of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The surrounding stroma is desmoplastic. My impression is that this is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon."
