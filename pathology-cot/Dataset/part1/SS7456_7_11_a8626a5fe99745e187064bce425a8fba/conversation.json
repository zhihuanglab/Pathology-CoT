At low power, this node appears almost completely replaced by a suspicious cellular population. I need to zoom in to assess the cytological features of these cells to confirm whether they are malignant and thus determine if the node is positive for metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the second lymph node from the left. This is part of a systematic examination of all submitted lymph nodes to search for metastatic cancer. I have chosen this area within the lymph node to begin my high-power examination because I need to assess the cellular composition and architecture. My goal is to look for clusters of atypical, non-lymphoid cells that would be indicative of metastatic adenocarcinoma, which often lodge in the subcapsular sinus or paracortical areas first. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the largest of the three lymph nodes. The specific area highlighted by the green box is at the periphery of the node, in the region of the subcapsular sinus. This is a critical area to examine because metastatic cells traveling through the lymphatic vessels typically first arrive and implant in the subcapsular sinus. Therefore, this is the highest-yield location to search for early or small metastatic deposits. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this specific area on the rightmost lymph node because it is located in the subcapsular sinus region. This is the first place tumor cells typically lodge when they metastasize to a lymph node via lymphatic drainage. The low-power view already suggests an abnormality here; the normally clear sinus space seems to be filled with cells, and the staining is less uniform than in the rest of the lymph node. This makes it a high-priority area to inspect for evidence of metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
