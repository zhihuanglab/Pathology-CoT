At low power, it appears almost entirely replaced by a different cell population, lacking the typical architecture of a reactive lymph node (e.g., distinct cortex, medulla, and germinal centers). This is highly suspicious for metastatic disease, and zooming in is necessary to examine the cellular morphology to confirm the presence of carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

On the right, there are sheets and poorly-formed glands of malignant epithelial cells. These cells are large with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. On the left, there is a dense infiltrate of small, dark, round cells, which are residual lymphocytes from the original lymph node. My impression is that this confirms the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma within a lymph node, making this a positive lymph node."
