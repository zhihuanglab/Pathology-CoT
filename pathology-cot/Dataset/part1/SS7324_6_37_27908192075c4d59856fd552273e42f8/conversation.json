At the bottom left, there is one distinct, ovoid, and densely basophilic (purple) tissue section, which has the classic appearance of a lymph node. My initial task would be to systematically examine this and any other potential lymph nodes for evidence of metastasis."

The specific zoom location is at the periphery of the node, which is a critical area to inspect as metastatic cells typically first arrive and implant in the subcapsular sinus.

There is a dense population of small, round, dark-staining lymphocytes, which is characteristic of normal or reactive lymphoid tissue. At the very bottom, a thin fibrous capsule is visible, with a subcapsular sinus just above it. The lymphoid architecture in this specific field of view appears preserved. I do not see any clusters of atypical epithelial cells, glandular structures, or extensive mucin pools that would indicate metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression of this particular area is that it is benign and negative for metastasis. However, I would need to scan the entire lymph node to make a definitive conclusion."
