Other smaller, scattered tissue fragments are present, some showing hemorrhage (red areas).

Its large size and dense, dark staining make it a primary target for assessing metastatic disease. The goal in examining a colorectal cancer resection is to identify all lymph nodes and check for tumor involvement (staging). This particular node is the most obvious candidate for examination, and its slightly variegated color on low power raises suspicion for partial replacement by tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The task for lymph nodes is to identify metastasis. The prominent, dark purple nodule is the most clearly identifiable lymph node on this slide at low magnification. Its distinct color and shape make it a primary target for examination. I would zoom into this area first to assess its architecture and cytology to determine if it is benign (reactive) or contains metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

On the periphery of the tissue fragments, there is a dense population of small, dark lymphocytes, which is residual normal lymph node tissue. Infiltrating and replacing the normal lymphoid parenchyma are irregular, back-to-back glands and nests of atypical epithelial cells. These cells are larger, have abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm, and large, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei. These features are characteristic of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The white space in the center is a processing artifact (tear in the tissue). My impression is definitive for a positive lymph node containing metastatic adenocarcinoma."
