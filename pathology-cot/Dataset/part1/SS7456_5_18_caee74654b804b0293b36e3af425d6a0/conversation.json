On the right, there is a large, ulcerated, and infiltrative tumor that appears to arise from the colonic mucosa. The tumor invades through the muscular wall into the pericolic fat on the left. Within the adipose tissue, there are several ovoid, basophilic structures, which are lymph nodes; I can discern at least 4-5 of them. The overall impression is an advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma (at least pT3) with regional lymph nodes to be assessed for metastasis."

This is the critical interface between the main tumor mass and the surrounding pericolic adipose tissue. Examining this area at high magnification is essential to: \n1. Confirm invasion beyond the muscularis propria into the pericolic soft tissues, which is required to establish a pT3 stage.\n2. Assess for adverse prognostic features that are often most evident at the leading edge, such as tumor budding, perineural invasion (PNI), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI).\n3. Evaluate the tumor grade and the nature of the host's stromal response (e.g., desmoplastic or inflammatory). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is placed at the invasive front of the tumor, specifically at the deepest point of invasion into the colonic wall. This is the most critical area to assess for determining the pathological T stage. A pathologist zooms into this area to evaluate the extent of tumor invasion: to see if the tumor is confined to the submucosa, has invaded the muscularis propria, or extends into the pericolic adipose tissue. The morphology of the invasive front (e.g., pushing vs. infiltrative border, presence of tumor budding) is also assessed here, as it has prognostic significance. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is placed at the deepest point of the tumor's invasion, at the interface between the main tumor mass and the surrounding tissue (submucosa/muscularis propria/pericolic fat). I would zoom into this area, known as the 'invasive front,' for several critical reasons: \n1. To determine the maximum depth of tumor invasion, which is essential for T-staging (e.g., to see if it has breached the muscularis propria and invaded into the pericolic adipose tissue, defining it as at least a pT3 tumor).\n2. To assess the tumor's histologic grade and morphology at its most aggressive part.\n3. To carefully search for poor prognostic features that are often best seen at the invasive front, such as lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), and high-grade tumor budding. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
