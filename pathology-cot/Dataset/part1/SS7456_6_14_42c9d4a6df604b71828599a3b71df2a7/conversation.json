The primary reason to zoom in here is to assess for extranodal extension (ENE), which is defined as tumor cells breaching the lymph node capsule and invading the adjacent fat. The presence of ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor, and this interface is the specific location where it must be evaluated. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area on the large lymph node to the left to examine the interface between the dense tumor infiltrate and the surrounding perinodal fat. This specific location is crucial for assessing extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the adjacent soft tissue. The presence of ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor and needs to be carefully evaluated and reported. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the large metastatic deposit in the lower-left tissue fragment. This specific area is at the interface between the main tumor mass and the surrounding adipose tissue. The purpose of examining this junction is to assess for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the perinodal fat. ENE is a critical prognostic factor, and this is the precise location to identify it. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically examine every potential lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The area highlighted by the green box is a well-defined, densely cellular nodule within the upper-right tissue fragment, which is morphologically consistent with a lymph node. I am zooming into this specific area to assess its architecture and cellular composition at high magnification to determine if it is a benign/reactive node or if it contains metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. This is one of the lymph nodes that appears to be involved by tumor. The zoomed-in area is located at the interface between the solid tumor deposit and the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue. I am zooming into this specific location to assess for extranodal extension (ENE). ENE is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat, which is a significant adverse prognostic factor and is critical for accurate staging. I need to examine this border at high power to see if the tumor has a smooth, pushing border or an irregular, infiltrative border. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to identify any lymph nodes containing metastatic tumor. I would systematically examine every potential lymph node on the slide. The green box is placed over one of the distinct, darkly stained nodules on the right-hand piece of tissue. Zooming into this area is essential to examine the cellular morphology and architecture to confirm if this is a lymph node and, if so, to determine whether the high cellularity is due to a benign reactive process or malignant infiltration. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
