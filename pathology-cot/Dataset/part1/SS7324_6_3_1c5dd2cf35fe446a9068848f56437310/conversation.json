To examine the subcapsular sinus, which is the area just beneath the lymph node capsule. This is a very common initial site for metastatic carcinoma cells to deposit after arriving via lymphatic drainage. \n2. To assess the integrity of the lymph node capsule and look for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the capsule into the surrounding fat. The interface between the lymph node and the pericolic fat is the key location to evaluate for ENE, a significant prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would zoom into this specific area because it is located at the periphery of a lymph node, at the interface between the lymphoid parenchyma and the surrounding perinodal fat and connective tissue. This subcapsular sinus region and the perinodal lymphatics are the most common initial sites for metastatic tumor cells to deposit. A thorough examination of this interface is critical to detect small metastatic foci that might not be apparent at low magnification. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the standard procedure for staging colorectal cancer involves examining every lymph node submitted to rule out metastasis. I would systematically review each node at higher magnification. The green box is placed on the most inferior lymph node within the larger cluster on the left. This zoom is part of that systematic examination to assess the cellular architecture and cytology of this specific node for any evidence of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node to screen for metastatic cancer cells. I zoomed into this specific area on the lymph node located on the right because it appears abnormal at low power. Unlike the surrounding uniform dark purple lymphoid tissue, this region shows a focal, irregular, paler pink area. This change in color and texture suggests a disruption of the normal lymph node architecture and is highly suspicious for infiltration by metastatic carcinoma, which is typically more eosinophilic than lymphoid tissue. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

These cells have enlarged, hyperchromatic, and pleomorphic nuclei with irregular contours and eosinophilic cytoplasm. My impression is that these are metastatic adenocarcinoma cells.
