This specific location is the interface between the lymph node capsule and the surrounding adipose tissue. Examining this junction is critical to assess for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the spread of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the pericapsular fat. ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. The irregular contour of the node at this point on low power also makes it a region of interest. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. The zoom area is focused on one of the lymph nodes located at the bottom of the image, slightly left of center. The purpose of zooming in here is to perform a high-magnification assessment of its architecture, specifically looking at the subcapsular sinus (the area just beneath the outer capsule) and the cortex for any atypical, non-lymphoid cells that would suggest metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically evaluate every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The area highlighted by the green box is one of the smaller lymph nodes located in the upper portion of the slide. This particular node appears homogenously dark and cellular at low power, which can be a sign that the normal architecture is effaced. This effacement could be due to metastatic carcinoma, so it's a critical area to examine at high magnification to make a definitive diagnosis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the lymph node on the far right of the image. At this low magnification, its architecture is effaced, meaning the normal structures like follicles and sinuses are replaced by a sheet-like growth of cells. This pattern is highly suspicious for metastatic carcinoma, which often obliterates the normal lymph node parenchyma. A high-power view is necessary to examine the cytology of these cells to confirm or rule out metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
