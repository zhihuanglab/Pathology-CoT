To determine the pathological T stage, it is crucial to assess the maximum depth of tumor invasion. This specific location appears to be at the interface between the bulk of the tumor and the submucosa or muscularis propria. By examining this area at high power, I can confirm the malignant nature of the infiltrating cells, characterize the pattern of invasion, and search for adverse features such as lymphovascular or perineural invasion, which are critical for staging and prognosis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I zoomed into this specific area because it represents the deepest point of tumor invasion. Determining the maximum depth of invasion is critical for assigning the correct T stage. This location is at the interface between the main tumor mass and the surrounding pericolic fat. I need to confirm the presence of malignant cells in the adipose tissue to establish a T3 stage and to look for other adverse prognostic features at the invasive front, such as tumor budding, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it represents the main body of the invasive tumor at its interface with the ulcerated surface. This region is critical for several reasons: 1) To confirm the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and assess its histologic grade (degree of differentiation). 2) To evaluate the morphology of the invasive front. 3) To look for specific features that have prognostic significance, such as mucin production or signet ring cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I zoomed into this specific area because it represents the invasive front of the tumor, which is the deepest point of invasion into the surrounding pericolic fat. Examining this interface is crucial for several reasons: \n1. To definitively determine the pathologic T stage (pT stage) by confirming tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria.\n2. To assess for adverse prognostic factors that are often best seen at the invasive front, such as tumor budding, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
