This morphology at low power is highly suggestive of a lymph node. As part of the cancer staging process, it is crucial to examine every lymph node for the presence of tumor cells. I am zooming into this specific nodule to assess its architecture and cellular composition at higher magnification to determine if it contains metastatic carcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area on the first large tissue fragment from the left because it shows an abnormal structure. There is a thick-walled, vessel-like or cystic structure with associated basophilic cellular material lining its inner surface. This appearance is highly suspicious for extramural venous invasion (EMVI), where a large vein is invaded by tumor. It is critical to examine this at high power to confirm the presence of tumor cells within a vessel, as EMVI is a major prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Alternatively, it could be a necrotic lymph node metastasis with a fibrotic capsule, which also requires closer evaluation. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

Some glands contain necrotic debris in their lumens. These features are characteristic of adenocarcinoma. The tumor is surrounded by a rim of residual lymphoid tissue and then by the perinodal adipose tissue on the right. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node, containing metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a colorectal primary."
