The specific area of interest is the periphery of the node, right under the capsule. This region, containing the subcapsular sinus, is the first place metastatic cells typically lodge after arriving via afferent lymphatic vessels. Therefore, it is a critical and high-yield area to scrutinize for evidence of metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the top-left lymph node. It is standard practice to carefully examine the capsule and subcapsular sinus of every lymph node, as this is the most common location for initial metastatic deposits. The selected area is at the interface between the lymphoid tissue and the surrounding perinodal fat, which is a critical region to assess for any breach of the capsule by tumor cells, a finding known as extranodal extension (ENE). Any irregularity or architectural disturbance in this area warrants high-magnification review. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine each lymph node on the slide to look for evidence of metastasis. The green box indicates a zoom into the third lymph node from the top (the middle one on the left). I am zooming into this dense, cellular area of the lymph node parenchyma to assess the cell population at high magnification. The key is to determine if the cells are native lymphocytes or if there are clusters of atypical, non-lymphoid cells, specifically malignant epithelial cells from the colorectal primary tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is part of the largest lymph node on the slide, located at the top. It is standard practice to systematically examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The specific location is the periphery of the node, just under the capsule. This subcapsular sinus region is the initial site where metastatic cancer cells typically deposit after arriving via afferent lymphatic vessels, making it a high-yield area for screening. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area because it is the periphery of the first lymph node (top right). Pathologists systematically examine each lymph node, often starting from the capsule and the subcapsular sinus. The subcapsular sinus is the initial site where metastatic cells, arriving via afferent lymphatic vessels, typically lodge. Therefore, this is a high-yield area to screen for early metastatic deposits before they invade the rest of the lymph node parenchyma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node. This is the first lymph node at the top right of the slide. I have zoomed into the periphery of the node because the subcapsular sinus, located just beneath the outer capsule, is the most common initial site for metastatic cells to deposit. Any subtle change in color (more pink/eosinophilic) or texture in this region at low power warrants high-power examination to rule out or confirm the presence of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area as part of a systematic examination of all submitted lymph nodes. This is the second lymph node from the top, located on the right. The selected area is within the cortex of the lymph node, which is a common site for initial metastatic deposits. I am assessing the morphology of the lymphoid follicles and looking for any atypical cell clusters that would suggest the presence of metastatic tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the lymph node located on the middle-right of the image. Specifically, I am targeting the subcapsular sinus, which is the area just beneath the outer fibrous capsule. This is a critical area to examine because metastatic tumor cells arriving via afferent lymphatic vessels first lodge and proliferate in this sinus. Additionally, even at low power, there appears to be some dark, irregular pigment in this region, which warrants closer inspection to identify its nature (e.g., tattoo ink, hemosiderin) and to ensure it is not obscuring any potential tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining each lymph node on the slide to search for evidence of metastasis. The green box is located on the fifth lymph node (bottom right). The zoom is placed towards the periphery of the node, near the subcapsular sinus. This is a critical area to examine, as it is the most common initial site for metastatic tumor cells to deposit after arriving via afferent lymphatic vessels. Even subtle changes in color or texture in this region warrant high-power evaluation. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the fourth lymph node from the top (the one in the center-bottom). At low power, this node contains a distinct, irregular, pale pink (eosinophilic) area that stands out against the dark purple (basophilic) lymphoid tissue. This appearance is classic for metastatic carcinoma replacing the normal lymph node parenchyma, and therefore, it is the highest priority area to examine at high magnification to confirm or rule out metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The majority of the field is occupied by malignant glandular structures. These are back-to-back, irregularly shaped glands lined by atypical, pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, consistent with adenocarcinoma. There are also flecks of dark pigment, likely carbon ink used for marking. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node containing metastatic adenocarcinoma from a colorectal primary."
