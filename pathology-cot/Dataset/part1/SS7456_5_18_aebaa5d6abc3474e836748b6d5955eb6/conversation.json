                "text": "I am systematically examining each potential lymph node. This is the first node located in the top-left corner. I have zoomed into the lower portion of this node, near the hilum/subcapsular area, because it appears slightly paler and more disrupted on the low-power view compared to the more uniform dark purple of the rest of the node. Such architectural alterations are suspicious for metastatic deposits, which often first appear in the subcapsular or medullary sinuses. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am starting my systematic review of the lymph nodes, beginning with the one in the top-left corner. The zoomed-in area is at the periphery of the lymph node, right under the capsule and adjacent to the surrounding fat. This is a critical area to inspect because metastatic tumor cells typically first arrive and implant in the subcapsular sinus, which is located just beneath the capsule. I am examining this region at high power to look for any atypical cells or glandular structures that would indicate metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my goal is to systematically examine every lymph node to definitively rule in or rule out the presence of metastatic tumor cells. This particular node, the fifth one I would examine in a systematic top-to-bottom, left-to-right review, is being evaluated as part of this routine screening. At low power, it appears to be a lymph node, but high-power examination is essential to identify any subtle tumor deposits (micrometastases) that would otherwise be missed. I am looking for any non-lymphoid cell clusters, abnormal glandular structures, or cells with atypical features. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this area as part of a systematic screening of all the lymph nodes provided. This particular node, located in the bottom right, is one of the larger ones. I am examining its internal structure to identify any potential metastatic tumor deposits, which would appear as clusters of atypical, non-lymphoid cells, often forming glands, contrasting with the normal lymphoid tissue. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into this specific area on the largest lymph node in the bottom row (second from right) because it appears to be almost entirely replaced by tumor. The purpose of this zoom is twofold: firstly, to confirm at high power that the dense cellular infiltrate is indeed metastatic adenocarcinoma, and secondly, and more importantly, to carefully examine the border between the tumor-infiltrated node and the surrounding adipose tissue to assess for extranodal extension (ENE). ENE is a critical prognostic factor and must be reported. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the task is to examine every lymph node on the slide for evidence of cancer metastasis. The zoom is directed at the first lymph node from the top right. I would systematically examine each tissue fragment at higher magnification. This particular node has a somewhat irregular, lobulated contour, which warrants a closer look to determine if the irregularity is due to tumor infiltration or a benign reactive process. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my standard procedure is to systematically examine every piece of tissue that could be a lymph node to check for the presence of metastatic cancer. The area highlighted by the green box is one of these discrete tissue fragments, specifically the second one from the top in the middle. I am zooming in to assess its architecture and cellular composition at high magnification to determine if it is indeed a lymph node and if it contains any tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol for staging colorectal cancer requires the meticulous examination of every single lymph node submitted, regardless of its size. The green box is over the fourth lymph node from the top (starting from the top left and moving across). Even small nodes like this one can contain micrometastases, which are crucial for accurate staging. Therefore, I am zooming into this area as part of a systematic review of all the lymph nodes on the slide to search for any evidence of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
