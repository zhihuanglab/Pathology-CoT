The overall architecture is disrupted, suggesting an invasive process."

To determine the N stage (lymph node status), it is critical to examine any potential lymph nodes for metastatic deposits. This specific area is the most prominent and suspicious-looking lymph node; therefore, zooming in is essential to confirm the presence of carcinoma and assess the extent of nodal involvement (e.g., extracapsular extension). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There is intraluminal necrotic debris (so-called 'dirty necrosis'), which is a characteristic feature of colorectal adenocarcinoma. An area of hemorrhage/necrosis is visible on the left. This field of view shows a lymph node almost completely effaced by metastatic carcinoma, confirming it as a positive lymph node."
