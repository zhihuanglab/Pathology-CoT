The area highlighted by the green box is clearly one of these well-circumscribed nodules. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic examination of all potential lymph nodes on the slide. This appears to be the largest and most distinct lymph node on the left side of the tissue. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to identify all lymph nodes on the slide and meticulously examine each one for evidence of metastasis. The large lymph node on the left is an obvious target, but it's crucial not to overlook smaller or fragmented nodes. The area selected for zoom is one of these smaller, somewhat irregularly shaped basophilic clusters. I would zoom into this area to determine if it is indeed a lymph node and, if so, to carefully scrutinize its architecture and cellular composition for any signs of infiltrating tumor cells, which may be subtle in a small focus. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

I do not see any atypical cells, such as large cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, nor do I see glandular formations or nests of epithelial cells that would indicate metastatic adenocarcinoma.
