The green box is placed directly over one of the structures I identified as a lymph node (specifically, the bottom-left one). I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. This zoom allows for a high-magnification assessment of the lymph node parenchyma and its interface with the surrounding perinodal fat, which is crucial for identifying metastatic tumor deposits and potential extracapsular extension. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my protocol is to systematically examine every potential lymph node to check for metastasis. The green box is focused on one of these lymph node candidates. I am zooming into the periphery of this node, specifically at the interface between the lymphoid parenchyma and the surrounding adipose tissue. This subcapsular sinus region is where metastatic cells often first deposit, so it is a critical area to scrutinize for any atypical cell clusters that would indicate a positive node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node identified at low power to search for evidence of metastatic cancer. The green box is placed on one of these well-defined, basophilic nodules. This is the fourth lymph node from the top, located centrally. The purpose of zooming in is to assess the cellular architecture and cytology of the node to determine if it is a reactive (negative) node or if it contains metastatic tumor cells, which is critical for cancer staging (determining the N-stage). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it clearly represents one of the lymph nodes that need to be assessed for cancer staging. This particular node is located in the uppermost cluster of tissue. As a pathologist, I must examine every lymph node meticulously to determine if cancer cells have spread from the primary colorectal tumor. Zooming in allows for a high-magnification assessment of the lymph node's architecture and cellular composition to search for any metastatic tumor deposits, which would make it a 'positive' lymph node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

In this specific field, I do not see any evidence of metastatic carcinoma. The lymph node appears to be reactive, given its high cellularity, but negative for malignancy in this view.
