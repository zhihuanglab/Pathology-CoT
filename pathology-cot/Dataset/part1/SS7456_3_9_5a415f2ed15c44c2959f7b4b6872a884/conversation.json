The area indicated by the green box corresponds to the first clearly identifiable lymph node from the left. I am zooming into this area to begin my systematic review of the lymph nodes, examining its architecture and cellular components at high magnification to look for any metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it contains a large, intensely basophilic, and irregularly shaped focus within what appears to be a lymph node. In the context of searching for metastatic colorectal cancer, such an appearance is highly suspicious for a large deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The goal is to examine this area at high magnification to confirm the presence of tumor cells, assess their morphology, and determine if there is extranodal extension. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the periphery of the large, suspicious lymph node on the right. This specific area is critical because it allows for the assessment of the interface between the lymph node and the surrounding adipose tissue. My primary objective is to look for extranodal extension (ENE), which is the invasion of tumor cells through the lymph node capsule into the perinodal fat. ENE is a significant adverse prognostic factor. Additionally, this view allows for the examination of any blood vessels in the vicinity for potential lymphovascular invasion. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

This is an inking artifact, likely from marking the specimen, which has been dragged across the tissue during sectioning. This artifact significantly obscures the underlying architecture. In the visible areas, I do not see definitive clusters of atypical glandular cells or signet ring cells that would indicate metastatic adenocarcinoma. My impression is that this is a lymph node, likely negative for metastasis in this field of view, but heavily compromised by artifact, requiring careful examination of the entire node."

This morphology is consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor appears to be breaking through the lymph node capsule and infiltrating the surrounding perinodal adipose tissue (fat), which is diagnostic of extranodal extension. My impression is a positive lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma and extranodal extension. The black lines are likely artifacts (folds in the tissue)."

To the left is adipose tissue, composed of adipocytes. A prominent, thick-walled blood vessel is present within the adipose tissue, adjacent to the involved lymph node. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node. The key question to answer now is whether there is extranodal extension. I need to carefully examine the border between the tumor mass and the fat for infiltrating tumor glands or single cells to confirm or rule out ENE. The adjacent blood vessel also needs to be scrutinized for vascular invasion."
