The tumor cells exhibit significant atypia, with large, hyperchromatic (darkly stained), and pleomorphic nuclei. There is a desmoplastic stromal reaction (dense fibrous tissue) surrounding the malignant glands, which is a typical response to invasion. The overall features are those of a lymph node largely effaced by metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma."
