This morphology is consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. These malignant glands are infiltrating the tissue, which is largely replaced by the tumor and a desmoplastic stromal response. Although residual lymphoid tissue is not prominent in this specific field, the overall context and low-power appearance confirm this is a lymph node almost completely effaced by metastatic carcinoma. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node."
