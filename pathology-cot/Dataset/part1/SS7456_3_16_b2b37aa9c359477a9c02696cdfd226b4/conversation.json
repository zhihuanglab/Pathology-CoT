On the left, there is a larger piece of tissue marked with black ink, which could be part of the primary tumor or a specific margin."

The normal lymphoid tissue is largely replaced by clusters and irregular glands of malignant cells. These cells have large, hyperchromatic, and pleomorphic nuclei with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm, which are features of adenocarcinoma. There is also a large area of eosinophilic, cracked material at the top of the image, which is consistent with tumor necrosis. The tissue to the left is mature adipose tissue. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma, showing extensive replacement of the nodal parenchyma and associated necrosis."
