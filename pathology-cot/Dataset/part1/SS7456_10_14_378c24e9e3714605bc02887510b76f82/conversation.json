The lymph node at the top right is large and densely basophilic, suggesting it is almost completely replaced by tumor. The lymph node on the bottom left is also enlarged and shows a large, irregular, basophilic deposit replacing the normal lymphoid tissue, with some darker, possibly calcified or necrotic, areas. A smaller lymph node is visible on the right. The overall impression is of multiple lymph nodes being evaluated, with at least two showing strong suspicion for metastatic disease."

The purpose of zooming in is to examine the cytology and architecture of these cells at high power to confirm if they are malignant glandular structures consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, and to assess for specific features like necrosis. This is a critical step for accurately staging the cancer (N staging). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I must examine every piece of tissue on the slide, not just the obvious lymph nodes. The area in the green box is a small, separate tissue fragment. At this low power, it's unclear what it is. It could be a small, completely effaced lymph node, a tumor deposit (TD), or a vessel with lymphovascular invasion (LVI). All of these have significant implications for staging and prognosis, so a high-power examination is essential to characterize this focus. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There are irregular, crowded malignant glands lined by columnar cells with hyperchromatic, elongated, and stratified nuclei. A prominent and characteristic feature is the extensive central 'dirty necrosis' within the glandular lumens. This necrosis is composed of granular eosinophilic material mixed with basophilic nuclear debris (karyorrhexis). My impression is definitive metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma within a lymph node."

The wall of this vein is infiltrated by clusters of malignant cells with large, irregular, dark-staining nuclei. The lumen contains an organizing thrombus (blood clot) that is also admixed with these malignant cells. My impression is that this is a clear case of extramural venous invasion (EMVI), which is a critical finding associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis."
