On the left, there is a large, densely cellular, basophilic (purple) area representing an infiltrative tumor. On the right, there is pale, paucicellular tissue with large empty spaces, characteristic of pericolic/perirectal adipose (fat) tissue. The tumor shows an irregular, invasive border with the fat, suggesting it has grown through the bowel wall. I do not see any definite lymph nodes in this low-power view; the focus appears to be on the primary tumor and its extent of invasion."

I would zoom into this specific location to: \n1. Evaluate the tumor's histologic grade by examining the degree of gland formation and cellular atypia.\n2. Assess for adverse prognostic features that are best seen at the invasive margin, such as tumor budding (small clusters of cancer cells) and the nature of the inflammatory response.\n3. Search for lymphovascular and perineural invasion, which are critical factors for determining the risk of metastasis.\n4. Confirm the depth of invasion into the surrounding soft tissue, which is essential for T staging. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

I see irregular, complex, and cribriform (sieve-like) glands infiltrating a desmoplastic stroma (dense fibrous tissue). The malignant cells lining these glands show significant nuclear pleomorphism (variation in size and shape), hyperchromasia (darkly stained nuclei), and loss of normal cellular polarity. There are also some small, detached nests of tumor cells within the stroma, which are highly suspicious for tumor budding. My impression is of an aggressive colorectal adenocarcinoma, and I would carefully continue to scan this invasive front for definitive vascular invasion and to quantify the tumor budding."
