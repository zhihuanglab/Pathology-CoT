The area shows a high degree of cellularity and architectural complexity. Examining this region at high power is necessary to confirm the presence of malignant cells, identify their morphology (e.g., glandular formation), and assess their features, which is crucial for confirming a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am zooming into the larger lymph node on the right to confirm the suspicion of metastasis. The selected area is strategically placed at the interface between the dense, dark purple cellular region and a paler, more varied area. This allows me to examine the morphology of the infiltrating cells, confirm they are malignant epithelial cells (carcinoma), and observe their interaction with the surrounding lymph node stroma and any residual lymphoid tissue. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
