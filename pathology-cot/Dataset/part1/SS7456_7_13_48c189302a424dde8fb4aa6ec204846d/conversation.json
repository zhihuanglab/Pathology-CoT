The area within the green box is one of the distinct tumor nodules. I would zoom into this area to confirm the malignant nature of the cells at high magnification, to assess the specific morphology of the tumor (e.g., glandular, cribriform), and to identify key diagnostic features like nuclear atypia and necrosis. This detailed examination is necessary to definitively classify the node as positive for metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am examining the second lymph node (the one on the lower right). I zoomed into this specific area because it shows a distinct, densely cellular, dark purple (basophilic) focus. This feature, representing a significant architectural abnormality within the lymph node parenchyma, is highly suspicious for a metastatic deposit. I need to examine the cytology at high power to confirm if this is tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
