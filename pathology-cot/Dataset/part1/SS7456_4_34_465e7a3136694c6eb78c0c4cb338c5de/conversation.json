The selected area is within the largest lymph node on the left side of the slide. I am zooming in to assess the cellular composition at high power to determine if the dense cellularity is due to a reactive lymphoid process or an infiltration by metastatic tumor cells. I need to look for atypical, non-lymphoid cells, such as glandular structures or nests of adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I need to examine every lymph node thoroughly. This zoom-in action is part of the systematic review of the lymph nodes. I am examining one of the medium-sized nodes located in the center of the slide. The specific area of interest is the periphery of the lymph node, adjacent to the surrounding fat. This is a critical region to inspect, as metastatic cells often first arrive and deposit in the subcapsular sinus. I am looking for any architectural distortion or clusters of atypical cells that would suggest metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine each lymph node to search for metastatic tumor cells. I have zoomed into this particular lymph node as part of that routine examination. The specific area of the zoom is centered on a linear disruption or tear in the tissue. It is crucial to examine such artifacts closely to confirm they are indeed processing-related and not a true pathological feature, and to ensure that no underlying pathology, such as a small metastatic focus, is being obscured by the tear. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist staging a colorectal cancer case, my primary goal is to meticulously examine every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The green box highlights one of the distinct lymph node fragments. I am zooming into this specific node as part of a systematic review of all submitted tissue. The purpose is to assess the node's architecture and cellular composition at a higher magnification to rule out the presence of metastatic tumor cells, which can be subtle (micrometastases or isolated tumor cells) and are not discernible at this low power. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is not centered on one of the main lymph node structures but rather in the perinodal adipose tissue. When evaluating a lymph node dissection, it is crucial to scan the fat between the nodes for isolated tumor deposits (satellite nodules) or lymphovascular invasion, which are important for staging. The area of the zoom contains some subtle, dark specks that require higher magnification to determine if they represent inflammatory cells, artifact, or small clusters of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would systematically examine every lymph node on the slide. The zoom into this area is part of that systematic review. This specific area targets one of the smaller, more isolated lymph nodes (the second one from the right, in the middle of the slide). The goal is to assess its architecture and cellular detail at high magnification to determine if it is a positive (containing cancer) or negative (reactive or normal) lymph node. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I would examine every lymph node on the slide. The zoom is on the lymph node located at the bottom-left corner of the slide. This represents the start of a systematic review of all the tissue present. The goal is to examine the node at high magnification to determine if there are any metastatic tumor cells, which would appear as atypical epithelial cells, often forming glands or clusters, contrasting with the normal lymphoid population. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."
