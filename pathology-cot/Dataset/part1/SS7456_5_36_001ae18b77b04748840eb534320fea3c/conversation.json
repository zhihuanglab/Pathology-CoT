As a pathologist, I would systematically examine each lymph node identified at low power to assess for the presence of metastatic tumor cells. This is a standard part of the cancer staging process. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically screening all potential lymph nodes on the slide. The highlighted area corresponds to the first lymph node on the far left of the tissue fragments. Zooming in is necessary to evaluate the architecture and cellular composition of the node at high magnification to determine if it is benign/reactive or if it contains metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist evaluating a colorectal cancer case, a critical part of the staging (N stage) is the meticulous examination of all harvested lymph nodes for evidence of metastasis. The green box is placed over the first lymph node from the left. I would zoom into this area as part of a systematic review of each lymph node to assess its architecture and cellular composition at high magnification, specifically looking for infiltrating nests of malignant glandular cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it is a clearly identifiable lymph node, located on the top left of the slide. When evaluating a case for staging, it is crucial to systematically examine every lymph node. This appears to be the first lymph node in a logical sequence of review. At low power, it is densely cellular and basophilic, which requires high-power examination to differentiate between a reactive lymph node and a node replaced by tumor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to identify all lymph nodes and examine them for metastatic cancer to determine the N stage. The green box is placed over a distinct, well-circumscribed, basophilic nodule located in the uppermost part of the tissue fragment on the far left. This is clearly a lymph node, and it is standard practice to systematically examine every single lymph node at high magnification. I am zooming into this first lymph node to begin my detailed assessment for the presence of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to systematically evaluate every lymph node for evidence of metastasis. The area highlighted by the green box is clearly one of the lymph nodes. I would zoom into this area, and every other lymph node, to assess its architecture at high magnification. The goal is to look for atypical cells, abnormal glandular structures, or other features that would indicate the presence of metastatic colorectal cancer. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, the task is to screen all submitted lymph nodes for metastatic disease. The area indicated by the green box is centered on one of the well-defined, basophilic structures that is clearly a lymph node. I would systematically examine each of these lymph nodes at higher magnification. This particular node, the second large one from the left in the upper cluster, is a prime target for detailed inspection to confirm it is a lymph node and to search for the presence of any atypical or malignant cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I am systematically examining all the lymph nodes present on the slide. The area indicated by the green box corresponds to one of the larger and more densely cellular lymph nodes. It is crucial to examine such nodes at high magnification to assess their architecture, look for any foreign cell populations (like metastatic carcinoma), and check for effacement of the normal lymphoid structure or capsular invasion. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it is clearly a lymph node, but its architecture is not uniform. Instead of being entirely composed of dense lymphoid tissue (dark purple), it shows a mottled appearance with lighter, more eosinophilic (pinkish) and irregularly basophilic areas. This heterogeneity is highly suspicious for effacement of the normal lymph node structure by an infiltrating process, most likely metastatic carcinoma. The goal is to examine this suspicious area at high magnification to confirm the presence or absence of tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because it is part of the systematic examination of all the submitted tissue. While not a well-circumscribed lymph node, this area in the fibrofatty tissue appears subtly more cellular and fibrotic than the surrounding adipose tissue. It is crucial to examine such areas carefully to look for small, isolated tumor nodules (tumor deposits), which are prognostically significant and affect the N stage (specifically, the N1c category if no lymph nodes are positive). I am also looking for other adverse features like lymphovascular or perineural invasion, which can be found in the pericolic fat away from obvious nodes. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, it is standard practice to examine every single lymph node identified in a cancer resection specimen to accurately determine the N (node) stage. The area highlighted by the green box contains one of these distinct, ovoid, basophilic structures consistent with a lymph node. I am zooming into this specific node, which is the rightmost one on the slide, as part of the systematic evaluation of all submitted lymph nodes. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The green box is centered on one of the basophilic nodules identified in the thumbnail view. As a pathologist evaluating a colorectal cancer case, the standard procedure is to systematically examine every single lymph node to check for metastasis, as this is a critical component of cancer staging (the 'N' in TNM staging). I am zooming into this specific nodule, one of the more centrally located ones, to examine its cellular composition at high magnification and determine if it is a benign (negative) lymph node or if it contains metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, I am systematically screening each lymph node present in the specimen. The green box is centered on one of these lymph nodes. I am zooming in to carefully examine the architecture of the node, particularly the subcapsular sinus and the perinodal fat. This area is a common site for the initial deposition of metastatic tumor cells, so a high-power examination is crucial to rule out or confirm the presence of metastasis. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The zoom area is located adjacent to a large lymph node in the bottom-right tissue fragment. At low power, this specific spot shows a small, dense, cellular focus within the perinodal fat, which is distinct from the main body of the lymph node. Such a finding is highly suspicious and requires high-magnification review to rule out or confirm critical staging features such as extranodal tumor extension, a satellite tumor deposit, perineural invasion (PNI), or lymphovascular invasion (LVI). I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

There are numerous, poorly-formed, and back-to-back malignant glands infiltrating a desmoplastic stroma. The tumor cells exhibit significant nuclear atypia, including hyperchromasia, irregular nuclear contours, and prominent nucleoli. Some glandular lumens contain necrotic debris (\"dirty necrosis\"). In the upper left corner, there is a rim of residual, dense lymphoid tissue, confirming that this is indeed a lymph node. My impression is metastatic adenocarcinoma within a lymph node, making this a positive lymph node."

These cells are arranged in small, irregular clusters and cords. The cells themselves have enlarged, hyperchromatic, and pleomorphic nuclei. This morphology is diagnostic of a tumor deposit of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma within the fibrofatty tissue. This is not a lymph node, but rather a focus of metastasis in the soft tissue."
