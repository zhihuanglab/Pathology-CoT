The overall architecture appears reactive, with some preserved follicular structures. I do not see any atypical glandular formations or clusters of malignant epithelial cells to suggest metastasis. The dark, thick band running across the node is an artifact, likely a fold in the tissue section or possibly ink. My impression is that this is a benign, reactive lymph node, negative for metastasis."
