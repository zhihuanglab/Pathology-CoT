In the context of staging colorectal cancer, my primary goal is to identify all lymph nodes and examine them for metastasis. This particular fragment has a distinct, somewhat nodular appearance suggestive of a lymph node, making it a high-priority target for initial examination. I would start here to assess for normal lymphoid architecture or the presence of metastatic tumor cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist staging a colorectal cancer case, my primary goal is to find every lymph node in the submitted tissue and examine it for tumor cells. The area indicated by the green box highlights a well-defined, more cellular and structured piece of tissue embedded within the surrounding fat. This is a high-probability candidate for being a lymph node. Therefore, I would zoom into this specific area to confirm its identity as a lymph node and to meticulously screen its architecture for any evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my primary task here is to identify all lymph nodes and examine them for metastasis. I would systematically scan the entire slide and zoom in on every piece of tissue that is not clearly fat. The area in the green box highlights a small, discrete, and relatively basophilic tissue fragment. At low power, its organized appearance distinguishes it from the surrounding hemorrhage and adipose tissue, making it a candidate for being a lymph node. Therefore, it is essential to zoom in to confirm if it is indeed a lymph node and to look for any signs of cancer cells. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. I would zoom into this area because the green box highlights a small, well-circumscribed, basophilic nodule embedded in adipose tissue. This appearance is highly characteristic of a lymph node. In staging colorectal cancer, it is critical to identify every lymph node and examine it at high magnification to look for metastatic tumor cells. This is a routine part of the systematic search for lymph nodes within the submitted pericolic fat. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. The pathologist zoomed into this area because it is a distinct, well-defined, and basophilic (purple) nodule, which is a classic low-power appearance of a lymph node. In cancer staging, it is crucial to examine every potential lymph node meticulously at high magnification to look for metastatic tumor cells. This is part of the routine systematic screening of all tissue on the slide. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

My impression is that this is not a lymph node but rather thyroid gland tissue.

This morphology is characteristic of thyroid tissue. There are also some large, congested blood vessels present. My impression is that this is not metastatic colorectal cancer. The findings are pathognomonic for thyroid tissue. This could represent a metastasis from a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, or benign ectopic thyroid tissue.

I do not see any features of colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis (e.g., atypical glands, necrosis, signet ring cells). The follicular structures themselves appear benign, without significant nuclear atypia, papillae, or mitotic activity. My impression is that this is a fragment of benign thyroid tissue, which is an unexpected finding in a colorectal cancer specimen.
