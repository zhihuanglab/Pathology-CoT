I can identify several well-defined, round to oval, basophilic (dark purple) structures embedded in pink adipose tissue. These are highly suggestive of lymph nodes. I can count at least three prominent lymph nodes and possibly a smaller one. The remaining tissue fragments appear to be composed of adipose tissue, fibrous tissue, and possibly muscle (far right). The primary task is to find positive lymph nodes, so these basophilic structures are the main targets for initial examination."

The green box is placed over a small, discrete, basophilic (darkly stained) nodule located in the pericolic fat, just superior to a larger, more obvious lymph node. Any such 'blue dot' in the fat must be investigated to determine if it is a small reactive lymph node, a lymph node completely replaced by tumor, or a tumor deposit (which has prognostic significance). Therefore, zooming in is essential for characterization. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]. As a pathologist, my task is to identify all lymph nodes and determine if they contain metastatic cancer. The area indicated by the green box is clearly a lymph node. At low power, it appears densely cellular and dark, which is highly suspicious for metastatic involvement. I am zooming in to confirm the presence of malignant cells, assess the extent of tumor replacement within the node, and critically, to look for evidence of extranodal extension (tumor breaking through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding fat), which is a crucial prognostic factor. I want to zoom into [coordinates not found]."

The nodule is composed of a dense population of small, round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, consistent with normal lymphoid architecture. There are some paler areas (follicular centers) within the lymphoid aggregate. Crucially, there are no atypical epithelial cells, abnormal glandular structures, or clusters of large, pleomorphic cells to suggest metastatic carcinoma. My impression is that this is a small, benign (reactive) lymph node, which is negative for metastasis."

The normal architecture of the lymph node, such as follicles and sinuses, is effaced. In the lower left, there is a ghost-like remnant of a lymphoid follicle. Crucially, on the left side of the image, the tumor cells can be seen infiltrating the perinodal adipose tissue and fibrous stroma, indicating definite extranodal extension. My impression is that this is a positive lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma showing extranodal extension."
